<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Of all the sovereigns that have worn the crown
of England, Queen Elizabeth is the most puzzling,
the most fascinating, the most blindly
praised, and the most unjustly blamed. To make
lists of her faults and virtues is easy. One may
say with little fear of contradiction that her intellect
was magnificent and her vanity almost incredibly
childish; that she was at one time the
most outspoken of women, at another the most
untruthful; that on one occasion she would manifest
a dignity that was truly sovereign, while on
another the rudeness of her manners was unworthy
of even the age in which she lived. Sometimes
she was the strongest of the strong, sometimes
the weakest of the weak.</p>

<p>At a distance of three hundred years it is not
easy to balance these claims to censure and to
admiration, but at least no one should forget that
the little white hand of which she was so vain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
guided the ship of state with most consummate
skill in its perilous passage through the troubled
waters of the latter half of the sixteenth century.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="subhead">THE BABY PRINCESS</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Two</span> ladies of the train of the Princess
Elizabeth were talking softly together in
an upper room of Hunsdon House.</p>

<p>“Never has such a thing happened in England
before,” said the first.</p>

<p>“True,” whispered the second, “and to think
of a swordsman being sent for across the water
to Calais! That never happened before.”</p>

<p>“Surely no good can come to the land when
the head of her who has worn the English crown
rolls in the dust at the stroke of a French executioner,”
murmured the first lady, looking half
fearfully over her shoulder.</p>

<p>“But if a queen is false to the king, if she
plots against the peace of the throne, even against
the king’s very life, why should she not meet the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
same punishment that the wife of a tradesman
would suffer if she strove to bring death to her
husband? The court declared that Queen Anne
was guilty.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the court, the court,” retorted the first,
“and what a court! If King Henry should say,
‘Cranmer, cut off your father’s head,’ and
‘Cromwell, cut off your mother’s head,’ they
would bow humbly before him and answer, ‘Yes,
sire,’ provided only that they could have wealth
in one hand and power in the other. A court,
yes!”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I’m to be in the train of the Princess
Elizabeth, and I’m not the one to sit on the
judges’ bench and say whether the death that
her mother died yesterday was just or unjust,”
said the second lady with a little yawn. “But
bend your head a bit nearer,” she went on, “and
I’ll tell you what the lord mayor of London
whispered to a kinsman of my own. He said
there was neither word nor sign of proof against
her that was the queen, and that he who had but
one eye could have seen that King Henry wished
to get rid of her. But isn’t that your brother
coming up the way?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
“Yes, it is Ralph. He is much in the king’s
favor of late because he can play the lute so well
and can troll a poem better than any other man
about the court. He will tell us of the day in
London.”</p>

<p>Ralph had already dismounted when his sister
came to the hall, too eager to welcome him to
wait for any formal announcement of his arrival.</p>

<p>“Greeting, sister Clarice,” said he as he kissed
her cheek lightly. “How peaceful it all is on
this quiet hill with trees and flowers about, and
breezes that bring the echoes of bird-notes rather
than the noise and tumult of the city.”</p>

<p>“But I am sure that I heard one sound of the
city yesterday, Ralph. It was the firing of a
cannon just at twelve. Was not that the hour
when the stroke of the French ruffian beheaded
the queen? Were there no murderers in England
that one must needs be sent for across the
water?”</p>

<p>“I had hardly thought you could hear the
sound so far,” said her brother, “but it was as
you say. The cannon was the signal that the
deed was done.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
“And where was King Henry? Was he
within the Tower? Did he look on to make sure
that the swordsman had done his work?”</p>

<p>“Not he. No fear has King Henry that his
servants will not obey him. He was in Epping
Forest on a hunt. I never saw him more full of
jest, and the higher the sun rose, the merrier
he became. We went out early in the morning,
and the king bade us stop under an oak tree to
picnic. The wine was poured out, and we stood
with our cups raised to drink his health. It was
an uproarious time, for while the foes of the
Boleyns rejoiced, their friends dared not be otherwise
than wildly merry, lest the wrath of the king
be visited upon them. He has the eye of an eagle
to pierce the heart of him who thinks the royal
way is not the way of right.”</p>

<p>“The wine would have choked me,” said Clarice,
“but go on, Ralph. What next?”</p>

<p>“One of the party slipped on the root of the
oak, and his glass fell on a rock at his feet. The
jesting stopped for an instant, and just at that moment
came the boom of a cannon from the Tower.
King Henry had forbidden the hour of the execution
to be told, but every one guessed that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
cannon was the signal that the head of Queen
Anne had been struck off by the foreign swordsman.
The king turned white and then red. I
was nearest him, and I saw him tremble. I followed
his eye, and he looked over the shoulder
of the master of the hunt far away to the eastward.
There was London, and up the spire of
St. Paul’s a flag was slowly rising. It looked
very small from that distance, but it was another
signal that the stroke of the executioner had been
a true one.”</p>

<p>“It is an awful thing to take the life of one
who has worn the crown,” murmured Clarice.
“Did the king speak?”</p>

<p>“He half opened his lips and again closed
them. Then he gave a laugh that made me
shiver, and he said, ‘One would think that the
royal pantry could afford no extra glass. That
business is finished. Unloose the dogs, and let
us follow the boar.’ Greeting, Lady Margaret,”
said Ralph to a lady who just then entered
the room. He bowed before her with deep respect,
and said in a low, earnest <span class="locked">tone:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“May you find comfort and courage in every
trouble that comes to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Lady Margaret’s eyes filled with tears as she
<span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I thank you. Trouble has, indeed, come to
me in these last few years. Where was the king
yesterday&mdash;at the hour of noon, I mean? Had
he the heart to stay in London?”</p>

<p>“He had the heart to go on a hunt, but it was
a short one, and almost as soon as the cannon was
fired, he set off on the hardest gallop that ever
took man over the road from Epping Forest to
Wiltshire.”</p>

<p>“To the home of Sir John Seymour?”</p>

<p>“The same. Know you not that this morning
before the bells rang for noon Jane Seymour
had taken the place of Anne Boleyn and become
the wife of King Henry?”</p>

<p>“No, I knew it not,” answered Lady Margaret,
“but what matters a day sooner or later
when a man goes from the murder of one wife
to the wedding of another?”</p>

<p>“True,” said Ralph. Clarice was sobbing
softly, and Lady Margaret went on, half to Ralph
and half to <span class="locked">herself:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“It was just two years ago yesterday when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
Lady Anne set out for London to be crowned. I
never saw the Thames so brilliant. Every boat
was decked with flags and streamers, edged with
tiny bells that swung and tinkled in the breeze.
The boats were so close together that it was hard
to clear a way for the lord mayor’s barge. All
the greatest men of London were with him. They
wore scarlet gowns and heavy golden chains. On
one side of the lord mayor was a boat full of
young men who had sworn to defend Queen
Anne to the death. Just ahead was a barge
loaded with cannon, and their mouths pointed in
every direction that the wind blows. There was
a great dragon, too, so cunningly devised that it
would twist and turn one way and then another,
and wherever it turned, it spit red fire and green
and blue into the river. There was another boat
full of the fairest maidens in London town, and
they all sang songs in praise of the Queen.”</p>

<p>“They say that Queen Anne, too, could make
songs,” said Ralph, “and that she made one in
prison that <span class="locked">begins:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>
<p>“When Anne Boleyn went to France with the
sister of King Henry, she was a merry, innocent
child. At his door lies the sin of whatever of
wrong she has done,” said Lady Margaret solemnly,
half turning away from Clarice and her
brother and looking absently out of the open
window. The lawn lay before her, fresh and
green. Here and there were daisies, gleaming
in the May sunshine. “I know the very place,”
said she with a shudder. “It is the green within
the Tower. The grass is fresh and bright there,
too, but the daisies will be red to-day with the
blood of our own crowned queen. It is terrible
to think of the daisies.”</p>

<p>“Pretty daisies,” said a clear, childish voice
under the window.</p>

<p>“Let us go out on the lawn,” said Clarice, “it
stifles me here.”</p>

<p>“Remember,” bade Lady Margaret hastily,
“to say ‘Lady,’ not ‘Princess.’”</p>

<p>The young man fell upon one knee before a
tiny maiden, not yet three years old. The child
gravely extended her hand for him to kiss. He
kissed it and <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Good morrow, my Lady Elizabeth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
“Princess ’Lizbeth,” corrected the mite.</p>

<p>“No,” said Lady Margaret, “not ‘Princess’
but ‘Lady.’”</p>

<p>“Princess ’Lizbeth,” insisted the child with a
stamp of her baby foot on the soft turf and a
positive little shake of her red gold curls. “Princess
brought you some daisies,” and with a winning
smile she held out the handful of flowers
to Lady Margaret and put up her face to be
kissed.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you one,” said the child to the young
man, and again she extended her hand to him.</p>

<p>“Princess ’Lizbeth wants to go to hear the
birds sing. Take me,” she bade the attendant.
She made the quaintest little courtesy that can be
imagined, and left the three standing under the
great beech tree.</p>

<p>“That is our Lady Elizabeth,” said Lady Margaret,
“the most wilful, winsome little lassie in
all the world.”</p>

<p>“But why may she not be called ‘Princess’
as has been the custom?” asked Ralph.</p>

<p>“It is but three days, indeed, since the king’s
order was given,” answered Lady Margaret.
“When Archbishop Cranmer decided that Anne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
Boleyn was not the lawful wife of Henry, the
king declared that Princess Elizabeth should no
longer be the heir to the throne, and so should be
called ‘Lady’ instead of ‘Princess.’ It is many
months since he has done aught for her save to
provide for her safe keeping here at Hunsdon.
The child lacks many things that every child of
quality should have, let alone that she be the
daughter of a king. I dare not tell the king
her needs, lest he be angry, and both the little one
and myself feel his wrath.”</p>

<p>The little daughter of the king seems to have
been entirely neglected, and at last Lady Margaret
ventured to write, not to the king, but to
Chancellor Cromwell, to lay before him her difficulties.
Here is part of her <span class="locked">letter:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Now it is so, my Lady Elizabeth is put from
that degree she was afore, and what degree she is
at now, I know not but by hearsay. Therefore
I know not how to order her myself, nor none
of hers that I have the rule of, that is, her women
and grooms, beseeching you to be good Lord
to my good Lady and to all hers, and that she
may have some raiment.” The letter goes on to
say that she has neither gown, nor slip, nor petticoat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
nor kerchiefs, nor neckerchiefs, nor nightcaps,
“nor no manner of linen,” and ends, “All
these her Grace must have. I have driven off
as long as I can, that by my troth I can drive it off
no longer. Beseeching ye, mine own good Lord,
that ye will see that her Grace may have that
which is needful for her, as my trust is that ye
will do.”</p>

<p>The little princess had a good friend in Lady
Margaret Bryan, the “lady mistress” whom
Queen Anne had put over her when, as the custom
was, the royal baby was taken from her mother to
dwell in another house with her own retinue of
attendants and ladies in waiting. In this same
letter the kind lady mistress ventured to praise
the neglected child. She wrote of <span class="locked">her:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“She is as toward a child and as gentle of
condition as ever I knew any in my life. I trust
the king’s Grace shall have great comfort in
her Grace.” Lady Margaret told the chancellor
that the little one was having “great pain with her
great teeth.” Probably the last thing that King
Henry thought of was showing his daughter to
the public or making her prominent in any way,
but the lady mistress sturdily suggested that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
he should wish it, the Lady Elizabeth would be
so taught that she would be an honor to the
king, but she must not be kept too long before the
public, she must have her freedom again in a day
or two.</p>

<p>A small difficulty arose in the house itself.
The steward of the castle wished the child to
dine at the state table instead of at her own more
simple board.</p>

<p>“It is only fitting,” said he, “for her to dine
at the great table, since she is at the head of
the house.”</p>

<p>“Master Steward,” declared Lady Margaret,
“at the state table there would be various meats
and fruits and wines that would not be for her
good. It would be a hard matter for me to keep
them from her when she saw them at every meal.”</p>

<p>“Teach her that she may not have all that
she sees,” said the steward.</p>

<p>“The table of state is no place for the correcting
of children,” retorted Lady Margaret, and
she wrote to the chancellor about this matter also.
“I know well,” said she, “if she [Elizabeth] be
at the table of state, I shall never bring her up
to the king’s Grace’s honor nor hers, nor to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
health. Wherefore I beseech you, my Lord, that
my Lady may have a mess of meat to her own
lodging, with a good dish or two that is meet
for her Grace to eat of.”</p>

<p>Besides the Lady Elizabeth and her household,
the lady mistress, the steward, the ladies of
her train, and the servants, there was one other
dweller in this royal nursery, and that was the
Lady Mary, a half-sister of the little Elizabeth.
Mary’s mother had been treated very cruelly and
unfairly by King Henry, and had finally been
put away from him that he might marry Anne
Boleyn.</p>

<p>As a child Mary was shown more honor than
had ever been given to an English princess before.
The palace provided for her residence was carried
on at an enormous expense. She had her own
ladies in waiting, her chamberlain, treasurer, and
chaplain, as if she were already queen. Even
greater than this was her glory when on one occasion
her father and mother were absent in
France, for she was taken to her father’s palace,
and there the royal baby of but three or four
years represented all the majesty of the throne.
The king’s councilors reported to him that when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
some gentlemen of note went to pay their respects
at the English court, they found this little
child in the presence chamber with her guards
and attendants, and many noble ladies most
handsomely apparelled. The councilors said that
she welcomed her guests and entertained them
with all propriety, and that finally she condescended
to play for them on the virginals, an instrument
with keys like those of a piano. If half
this story is true, it is no wonder that the delighted
courtiers told the king they “greatly
marvelled and rejoiced.”</p>

<p>The following Christmas she spent with her
father and mother. She had most valuable presents
of all sorts of articles made of gold and
silver; cups, saltcellars, flagons, and&mdash;strangest
of all gifts for a little child&mdash;a pair of silver snuffers.
One part of the Christmas celebration must
have pleased her, and that was the acting of several
plays by a company of children who had
been carefully trained to entertain the little
princess.</p>

<p>When Mary was but six years old, it was arranged
that she should marry the German emperor,
Charles V. He came to England for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
betrothal, and remained several weeks. Charles
ruled over more territory than any other sovereign
of the times, and he was a young man of
great talent and ability. The child must be educated
to become an empress. Being a princess
was no longer all play. A learned Spaniard
wrote a profound treatise on the proper method
of training the little girl. He would allow her to
read the writings of some of the Latin poets and
orators and philosophers, and she might read
history, but no romances. A Latin grammar was
written expressly for her, and she must also study
French and music. There seems to have been
little thought of her recreation save that it was
decreed that she might “use moderate exercise at
seasons convenient.”</p>

<p>So it was that the pretty, merry little maiden
was trained to become an empress. When she
was ten years old, she sent Charles an emerald
ring, asking him whether his love was still true
to her. He returned a tender message that he
would wear the ring for her sake; and yet, the
little girl to whom he had been betrothed never
became the bride of the emperor.</p>

<p>Charles heard that King Henry meant to put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
away his wife, and if that was done, it was probable
that Mary would no longer be “Princess of
Wales,” and would never inherit her father’s
kingdom. The emperor was angry, and the little
girl in the great, luxurious palace was hurt and
grieved.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the hard life that
lay before her. King Henry was determined to
be free from his wife that he might make Anne
Boleyn his queen. Mary loved her mother with
all her heart, but the king refused to allow them
to see each other. The mother wrote most tenderly
to her child, bidding her be cheerful and
obey the king in everything that was not wrong.
Mary’s seventeenth birthday came and went.
The king had accomplished his wish to put away
his wife, and had made Anne Boleyn his queen.
One September day their child Elizabeth was
born. So far Mary had lived in the greatest state,
surrounded by attendants who delighted in showing
deference to her wishes, and her only unhappiness
had been caused by the separation from
her mother and sympathy with her mother’s sufferings.
One morning the chamberlain, John
Hussey, came to her with downcast eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
“Your Grace,” said he, “it is but an hour ago
that a message came from his Majesty, the king,
and&mdash;&mdash;” His voice trembled, and he could say
no more.</p>

<p>“Speak on, my good friend,” said Mary. “I
can, indeed, hardly expect words of cheer from
the court that is ruled by her who was once my
mother’s maid of honor, but tell me to what
purport is the message?”</p>

<p>“No choice have I but to speak boldly and far
more harshly than is my wish,” replied the chamberlain,
“and I crave your pardon for saying
what I would so gladly leave unsaid. I would
that the king had named some other agent.”</p>

<p>“But what is the message, my good chamberlain?
Must I command it to be told to me?
My mother’s daughter knows no fear. I am
strong to meet whatever is to come.”</p>

<p>“The king commands through his council,”
said the chamberlain in a choking voice, “that
your Grace shall no longer bear the title of
‘Princess,’ for that belongs henceforth to the
child of himself and Queen Anne. He bids that
you shall order your servants to address you as
‘Lady Mary,’ and that you shall remove at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
to Hunsdon, the palace of the Princess Elizabeth,
for she it is who is to be his heir and is to inherit
the kingdom.”</p>

<p>“I thank you,” said Mary calmly, “for the
courtesy with which you have delivered the message;
but I am the daughter of the king, and
without his own letter I refuse to believe that he
would be minded to diminish the state and rank
of his eldest child.”</p>

<p>A few days later there came a letter from an
officer of the king’s household bidding her remove
to the palace of the child Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“I will not accept the letter as the word of
my father,” declared Mary. “It names me as
‘Lady Mary’ and not as ‘Princess’;” and she
straightway wrote, not to the council, but directly
to the <span class="locked">king:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I will obey you as I ought, and go wherever
you bid me, but I cannot believe that your
Grace knew of this letter, since therein I am addressed
as ‘Lady Mary.’ To accept this title
would be to declare that I am not your eldest
child, and this my conscience will not permit.”
She signs herself, “Your most humble daughter,
Mary, Princess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
King Henry was angry, and when Queen Anne
came to him in tears and told him a fortune-teller
had predicted that Mary should rule after
her father, he declared that he would execute her
rather than allow such a thing to happen. Parliament
did just what he commanded, and now
he bade that an act be passed settling the crown
upon the child of Queen Anne. Mary’s luxurious
household of more than eightscore attendants
was broken up, and she herself was sent to Hunsdon.
Many of her attendants accompanied her,
but they were bidden to look no longer upon her
as their supreme mistress. They were to treat
the child Elizabeth as Princess of Wales and
heir to the throne of England.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="subhead">THE CHILD ELIZABETH</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">It</span> was a strange household at Hunsdon, a
baby ruler with crowds of attendants to do
her honor and obey her slightest whim.
Over all was the strong hand of the king, and
his imperious will to which every member of the
house yielded save the one slender girl who paid
no heed to his threats, but stood firmly for her
mother’s rights and her own.</p>

<p>For more than two years all honor was shown
to the baby Elizabeth, but on the king’s marriage
to Jane Seymour, he commanded his obedient
Parliament to decree that Elizabeth should never
wear the crown, and that, if Jane had no children,
the king might will his kingdom to whom he
would. To the little child the change in her
position was as yet a small matter, but to the
young girl of twenty-one years the future seemed
very dark. Her mother had died, praying in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
vain that the king would grant her but one hour
with her beloved daughter. Mary was fond of
study and spent much of the time with her books.
Visitors were rare, for few ventured to brave
the wrath of Henry VIII., but one morning it
was announced that Lady Kingston awaited her
Grace.</p>

<p>“I give you cordial greeting,” said Mary.
“You were ever true to me, and in these days
it is but seldom that I meet a faithful friend.”</p>

<p>“A message comes to your Grace through me
that will, I hope, give you some little comfort,”
said Lady Kingston.</p>

<p>“From my father?” cried Mary eagerly.</p>

<p>“No, but from one whose jealous dislike may
have done much to turn the king against you,
from her who was Anne Boleyn. The day before
her death,” continued Lady Kingston, “she
whispered to me, ‘I have something to say to
you alone.’ She sent away her attendants and
bade me follow her into the presence chamber of
the Tower. She locked and bolted the door with
her own hand. Then she commanded, ‘Sit you
down in the royal seat.’ I said, ‘Your Majesty,
in your presence it is my duty to stand, not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
sit, much less to sit in the seat of the queen.’ She
shook her head and said sadly, ‘I am no longer
the queen. I am but a poor woman condemned
to die to-morrow. I pray you be seated.’ It
seemed a strange wish, but she was so earnest
that I obeyed. She fell upon her knees at my
feet and said, ‘Go you to Mary, my stepdaughter,
fall down before her feet as I now fall before
yours, and beg her humbly to pardon the wrong
that I have done her. This is my message.’”</p>

<p>Mary was silent. Then she said <span class="locked">slowly:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Save for her, my mother’s life and my own
would have been full of happiness, but I forgive
her as I hope to be forgiven. The child whom
she has left to suffer, it may be, much that I have
suffered, shall be to me as a sister&mdash;and truly, she
is a winsome little maiden.” Mary’s face softened
at the thought of the baby Elizabeth.</p>

<p>She kept her word, and it was but a few weeks
before Mary, who had once been bidden to look
up to the child as her superior, was generously
trying to arouse her father’s interest in his forsaken
little daughter. Henry VIII., cruel as he
showed himself, was always eager to have people
think well of him, and in his selfish, tyrannical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
fashion, he was really fond of his children. Mary
had been treated most harshly, but she longed to
meet him. Her mother was dead, she was alone.
If he would permit her to come to him, it might
be that he would show her the same kindness and
affection as when she was a child. She wrote
him submissive letters, and finally he consented
to pardon her for daring to oppose his will.
Hardly was she assured of his forgiveness before
she <span class="locked">wrote:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“My sister Elizabeth is in good health, thanks
to our Lord, and such a child as I doubt not but
your Highness shall have cause to rejoice of in
time coming.”</p>

<p>The months went by, and when Elizabeth was
about four years old, a message came from the
king to say that a son was born to him, and that
the two princesses were bidden to come to the
palace to attend the christening.</p>

<p>Such a celebration as it was! The queen was
wrapped in a mantle of crimson velvet edged with
ermine. She was laid upon a kind of sofa on
which were many cushions of damask with
border of gold. Over her was spread a robe of
fine scarlet cloth with a lining of ermine. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
the procession, the baby son was carried in the
arms of a lady of high rank under a canopy
borne by four nobles. Then came other nobles,
one bearing a great wax candle, some with towels
about their necks, and some bringing bowls and
cups, all of solid gold, as gifts for the child who
was to inherit the throne of England. A long
line of servants and attendants followed. The
Princess Mary wore a robe of cloth of silver
trimmed with pearls. Every motion of hers was
watched, for she was to be godmother to the
little child. There was another young maiden
who won even more attention than the baby
prince, and this was the four-year-old Princess
Elizabeth. She was dressed in a robe of state
with as long a train as any of the ladies of the
court. In her hand she carried a golden vase
containing the chrism, or anointing oil, and she
herself was borne in the arms of the queen’s
brother. She had been sound asleep when the
time came to make ready for the ceremony, for
the christening took place late in the evening, and
the procession set out with the light of many
torches flashing upon the jewels of the nobles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
and ladies of rank and upon the golden cups and
bowls.</p>

<p>Along the wide hall and down the grand staircase
went the glittering line. The baby was
christened “Edward,” and then was proclaimed
“the beloved son of our most dread and gracious
Lord, Henry VIII.” On the return the little
Elizabeth walked beside Mary, keeping fast hold
of her sister’s hand, while the long train was
borne by a noble lady of the court. The trumpet
sounded all the way back to the royal bedchamber
where lay the queen, waiting to greet her son
with her blessing. It was midnight, and Elizabeth
as well as her baby brother must have been
glad to be allowed to rest.</p>

<p>Only a few days later came the death of the
mother of the little prince. Greatly as King
Henry disliked black, he wore it for four months,
even on Christmas day. Elizabeth was probably
at Hunsdon, but Mary spent Christmas with her
father. She did not forget the little sister, but
sent her a box decorated with silver needlework
made by her own hand. She gave the baby
brother a cap which must have been very elaborate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
for it cost enough to pay the wages of a
working man for four months. To the baby’s
nurse she sent a bonnet that cost half as much
as the cap. Another gift, which she herself made,
was a cushion covered with rich embroidery.</p>

<p>This baby brother was a delight to both the
princesses. Mary went often to see him, and
looked after him as if he had been her own child,
and to Elizabeth he was the most precious thing
in all the world. “I pray you, take me to see my
brother,” she often pleaded. One day the older
sister said to her, “Elizabeth, is there aught that
I can do to please you greatly?”</p>

<p>“I would gladly go to see my brother,” was
the child’s answer.</p>

<p>“That cannot well be,” said Mary. “Is there
nothing better that you can wish?”</p>

<p>“No, sister.”</p>

<p>“But there is surely one thing better. When
it is two of the clock, stand you close by the west
window of the hall, and what is to come will
come.”</p>

<p>Clocks were not very common in those days,
but there was one in the hall at Hunsdon, and the
excited little girl watched the hands move slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
around until they marked the hour of two. What
was to come?</p>

<p>A little after two a single rider appeared.
“Make way for his Grace, Edward, Prince of
Wales!” he cried. Then came the trumpeters
and, following them, the nobles. After the nobles
came the royal baby for whom all this ceremonial
had been arranged. He lay in the arms of his
nurse, “Mother Jack,” and was borne in a litter.
The upright poles were heavily gilded, and the
canopy was of the richest white silk edged with
a golden fringe. Clusters of white plumes were
fixed at each corner. On the shoulders of eight
men rested the shafts of the chair. All around it
gathered noble lords and ladies, mounted on
horses whose trappings were marked with the
monogram of many a family of rank and power.
Every man wore a sword to defend the heir of
England’s king, if need should arise, and stalwart
guards marched on either side.</p>

<p>“It’s my own little brother,” cried Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“And he comes to abide with us for a while,”
said Mary. “Is not that better, my little sister,
than going to him to pay a visit of a day?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
“Will Lady Margaret grant me leave to show
him my birds and my rabbits? He shall play on
my virginals, if he will; and, truly, I’ll not mind
the sharp prick of the needle, if I may but sew a
dress for him. I would fain learn to make letters
with the needle, sister Mary, that I might sew
one all myself on everything that he will wear.
Oh, it will be an ‘E,’ even as it is on whatever
is mine.”</p>

<p>It is quite possible that the next few years were
the happiest that Elizabeth ever knew. She was
four years older than Edward, and she had been
so carefully trained by Lady Margaret that King
Henry was glad that she should be the playmate
of the sweet-tempered little fellow who was his
only son and heir. Lady Margaret was troubled
because Edward’s best coat was “only tinsel”
instead of cloth of gold, and because he had
“never a good jewel to set on his cap;” but this
was nothing to the little prince so long as he
had his sister. Lady Margaret wrote to the king
that she wished he could have seen the prince, for
“the minstrels played, and his Grace danced and
played so wantonly that he could not stand still.”
Elizabeth taught him to speak, and for his sake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
she even conquered her dislike to the “prick of
the needle,” for when his second birthday came
and the rich nobles of the kingdom sent him
jewels and all sorts of beautiful things made of
gold and silver, she gave him a tiny cambric shirt,
every stitch of which had been made by the little
fingers of his six-year-old sister. Mary sent him
a cloak of crimson satin. The sleeves were of
tinsel. It was heavily embroidered with gold
thread and with pansies made of pearls.</p>

<p>It was about this time that King Henry sent
an officer of high rank expressly to bestow the
royal blessing upon the two princesses. On his
return he reported to the king the grateful message
that Mary had sent.</p>

<p>“And how found you her Grace, the Lady
Elizabeth?” asked King Henry.</p>

<p>“Truly, your Majesty,” replied the chancellor,
“were the Lady Elizabeth not the offspring of
your illustrious Highness, I could in no way account
for her charm of manner and of speech.
‘I humbly thank his most excellent Majesty,’ she
said, ‘that he has graciously deigned to think
upon me, who am verily his loving child and his
true and faithful subject.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
“She is but six years old,” mused Henry.
“Were those her words?”</p>

<p>“I would gladly have had pen and paper,”
answered the chancellor, “that no one of them
should have been lost, but I give the message as
it has remained in my memory. She asked after
your Majesty’s welfare with as great a gravity
as she had been forty years old.”</p>

<p>More than one trouble came to the older princess.
Soon after the king had sent his blessing
to the two sisters, a councilor came to Mary with
a message of quite another character.</p>

<p>“It is his Majesty’s pleasure,” said he, “that
your Grace should receive the Duke Philip of
Germany as a suitor for your hand.” This German
duke was a Protestant, and Mary was a firm
Roman Catholic, but she dared not refuse to obey
the king’s bidding.</p>

<p>“I would gladly remain single,” said she, “but
I am bound to obey his Majesty. I would, too,
that the duke were of my own faith, but in so
weighty a matter I can do naught save to commit
myself to my merciful father and most sovereign
lord, knowing that his goodness and wisdom will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
provide for me far better than I could make provision
for myself.”</p>

<p>The duke sent her a beautiful diamond cross,
but before a year had passed, she was bidden by
the king to return the gift. Henry had wedded
a German wife, and had treated her so badly that
Mary’s betrothal was broken.</p>

<p>There were sad times in England in those days.
When Henry VIII. wished to marry Anne
Boleyn, he asked the Pope to declare that his
marriage to the mother of Mary was not lawful.
The Pope refused. Henry then asked the opinion
of several universities in England, Italy, and
France, and it is probable that his question was
accompanied by either bribes or threats. The
universities declared the first marriage unlawful,
but the Pope would not yield. Henry then declared
that the English church should be free
from the Pope, and that the king himself was
properly the supreme head of the church in his
own kingdom.</p>

<p>There were tyrants, and most cruel tyrants
before the days of Henry VIII., but they were
generally satisfied to rule men’s deeds. Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
was determined to rule his subjects’ most secret
thoughts. If he suspected that a man did not
believe that his divorce was right, he would
pursue the man and force him to express
his opinion. If the man was too honest to
tell a falsehood, he was imprisoned or executed,
for Henry said that it was treason to
refuse to acknowledge that the king of England
was at the head of the church of England. Many
of the noblest, truest men in the land were put
to death for this reason. This was not all, for
although Henry would not acknowledge the
authority of the Pope, he nevertheless declared
that he was a Roman Catholic, and that all Protestants
were heretics and deserved to be burned to
death. The result of this strange reasoning was
that if a man was a Protestant, he ran the risk of
being burned at the stake, while if he was a Roman
Catholic, he was in danger of being hanged.</p>

<p>Mary was often at the court. She must have
heard her father’s brutal threats against all those
who did not love his will. One after another of
her childhood’s friends was beheaded or burned at
the stake; her old teacher, her mother’s chaplain,
and the beloved countess to whose care her mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
had confided her as an infant. Not a word or
look of criticism might she venture, for the despot
would hardly have hesitated to send his own
daughter to the stake if she had dared to resist
him in this matter.</p>

<p>The case was quite different with Elizabeth and
Edward. They knew little of burnings and executions.
Whatever of gentleness and kindness
was in King Henry was shown to the children, especially
to his son. The little ones played and
studied together. “My sweetest and dearest
sister” was the little boy’s name for Elizabeth.
She was a favorite wherever she went. The king
married three times after the death of Jane Seymour,
and each of these stepmothers was fond of
the merry, pleasing little girl.</p>

<p>The first of the three was the German princess.
She was rather slow and dull, and Henry took a
great dislike to her. When the little Elizabeth,
then about seven years old, begged to be allowed
to come to court to see the queen, King Henry
roared, “Tell her that her own mother was so
different from this woman that she ought not
to wish to see her.” This was the only time that
he ever spoke of Anne Boleyn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Elizabeth met the new stepmother after a short
delay, and this lady was so charmed with the little
maiden that she begged to see much of her, the
only favor that she ever asked of the king. The
next wife was a distant relative of Anne Boleyn,
and when she dined in public, she gave the place
opposite herself to the child. “She is of my own
blood,” said the queen, “and it is only right that
she should be next to me.”</p>

<p>At Henry’s last marriage Mary and the two
children were present, and this new queen became
like the others a warm friend of Elizabeth, who
was now fully ten years old. Henry must have
felt some affection for Anne Boleyn, for he was
never displeased to hear the praises of her
daughter. He seemed beginning to have a real
fondness for the child, and one day he looked at
her keenly and <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“There’s more than one that would be glad to
have you. Would you be married, Elizabeth, or
would you stay with your books and birds and
viols and lutes?”</p>

<p>“I would fain do that which your Majesty
bids,” answered the child. “I know well that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
what your Majesty commands is ever the thing
which is best.”</p>

<p>“She’s a child of wisdom,” declared Henry
with a smile of gratification, “and I’ll do more for
her than anyone can guess.” Then said he to
<span class="locked">Elizabeth:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“It shall be brought about that you shall become
the bride of some great man. If any German
emperor plays you false, he shall feel the
weight of my hand. How would it please your
Grace to marry a prince of Portugal?” he asked
playfully, for he was in a rarely good humor,
“or perhaps Philip of Spain? Philip will be a
king, and he would make you a great lady. Would
it please you to wed one that would make you
a queen?”</p>

<p>“Far rather would I wed one that I could
make a king,” answered the child, drawing herself
up to her full height.</p>

<p>“What!” cried the king, his face changing in
a moment, and his eyes flashing ominously. The
girl seemed looking not at the king, but far away
into some distant future. She did not see the
warning glance of the queen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
“I would fain be so beautiful and so great,”
said she, “that whoever came near me should admire
me and should beg me to become his wife.
I would say no to one and all, but by and by I
would choose one for myself. Him I would
raise to be as great as I, and I would&mdash;&mdash;” Elizabeth
of England, even as a child, rarely forgot
herself, but she was absorbed in the picture that
she was making, and she stopped only when she
felt the silence and saw her father’s wrathful gaze
fixed upon her. His eyes were fairly blazing with
anger, and his face was purple.</p>

<p>“So that is what you plan, is it?” he roared.
“And here you stand before me and tell your
schemes to become queen and raise some miserable
rascal to the throne. Get out of my sight, ingrate
that you are.”</p>

<p>Quick-witted as Elizabeth was, she did not at
once see wherein she was in fault. She was so
dazed by this sudden fury that she did not even
think to throw herself at the feet of the king and
beg to be forgiven, even though she knew not for
what. The stepmother pleaded, “Pardon the
child, my king. She meant no wrong.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
“No wrong,” thundered the king. “Is it ‘no
wrong’ to plan what she will do as soon as the
breath is out of her father’s body? I tell you,
girl, that you may find another father and another
throne, for never shall you sit upon mine. Get
to your litter, and do you never come before my
eyes again.”</p>

<p>The little Edward had slipped up softly behind
his angry father and had laid his tiny hand upon
the king’s purple cheek.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty is naughty,” he declared
gravely. “You have made my sweetest sister
cry. I don’t want my sister to cry.” Never had
the little boy received a harsh word from his
father, and he was perhaps the only one in the
kingdom who had no fear of the king. “Come,”
said he, “and tell her not to cry.” He caught the
king by the hand, but even for his son King
Henry’s anger could not be suppressed.</p>

<p>“You little know her,” he said. “It is you
that she would rob. She would seize upon the
place that is your own and drive you from it. Tell
her to depart from the palace and never enter it,”
he commanded his chamberlain, and soon the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
girl, not yet twelve years old, was sent away from
the court in disgrace.</p>

<p>“Hold yourself with patience,” whispered the
queen to the child. “Trust me, and believe that it
shall not be long before you will again be sent for.”</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="subhead">A BOY KING</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> queen did all in her power for the little
offender, but it was a whole year before
she was again allowed to come to court.
There was war in France, and the king sailed
away in his ship with its sails of cloth of gold,
apparently forgetting all about the little daughter
whom he had left without a word of farewell.
The child dared not write him, but she wrote the
queen a grateful little Italian letter. “I feel
bound not only to be obedient to you,” she said,
“but also to look up to you with filial love, and
chiefly because I learn that you, most illustrious
Highness, never forget me in your letters to his
Majesty, the king.” Then she begged the queen
when writing the king, always to speak of her.
“Commend me to him with my continual prayer
that he will give me his kind blessing,” pleaded
the anxious child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
After keeping his anger for a whole year, the
king finally deigned to send his blessing to “all”
his children. The poor little girl was comforted,
and made so happy by this tardy forgiveness that
she cast gratefully about her to see what she could
do to show her gratitude to the kind stepmother
who had done so much to appease his wrath. She
knew of a little French book that was a favorite
of the queen’s, and this she translated into English
and sent to her. The cover was embroidered
in blue and silver, and there was a quaint little
dedication saying that she knew nothing in it
“was done as it should have been.” It is no
wonder that the grateful child became a great
favorite with her kind-hearted stepmother.</p>

<p>Henry was successful in France; England had
been well governed by the queen during his absence;
he was on good terms with all his family;
and although there had been a visitation of the
plague, his children were safe. It was probably
at this happy time that a large picture was painted
of Henry, his three children, and the mother of
Edward. The king sits on a kind of dais with
Jane Seymour beside him. He is gorgeous in
scarlet and gold brocade, and his two daughters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
are almost equally dazzling in their crimson velvet
and cloth of gold. The precious little prince
stands at his father’s right hand, and the king’s
arm is thrown around the child’s neck. Both
king and prince wear velvet caps, each with a
long white plume. Gold chains and rubies and
pearls are everywhere.</p>

<p>Queen Katherine does not appear in the picture,
but she had a strong hold on the daily lives of the
royal family. She saw to it that so far as lay in
her power the neglected elder daughter should
have the position that belonged to her. Princess
as she was, Mary never had after her mother’s divorce
an allowance half large enough to do what
was expected of her, but now she was helped in
many ways by the thoughtful stepmother. The
queen would send a handsome gown or a generous
gift of money, or she would arrange to pension
off some aged, helpless servant of Mary’s, and
so lessen the demands upon the girl’s slender
purse. She was little older than the princess,
but she showed a motherly watchfulness of
Mary’s interests.</p>

<p>No less thoughtful was she of the training of
her younger stepchildren. It was the fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
for young people of rank to be highly educated,
especially in the languages, and if half the reports
of the knowledge acquired by the two children are
true, they must have been wonderfully industrious
students. One who knew them well declared
that they called for their books as soon as it was
light. First came the reading of the Scriptures,
then breakfast, and after that the study of various
languages. When the long hours of work
were over, the little prince was allowed to exercise
in the open air, while Elizabeth “betook
herself to her lute or viol, and when wearied with
these, employed her time in needle-work.” Four
or five modern languages this industrious princess
learned to speak and write. She had some
knowledge of Greek, and she spoke Latin almost
as easily as English. A little book in which she
wrote her Italian exercises is still in existence.
They are well written, but there are mistakes
enough to show that even a princess does not
learn a language without hard work.</p>

<p>Both children had a great admiration for Queen
Katherine, and whatever she did was right in
their eyes. Edward seems to have had as hard a
time learning to write as any child of to-day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
and he sent a letter to the queen about his troubles.
“When I see your beautiful handwriting,”
says the discouraged little boy, “I am sick of
writing. But then I think how kind your nature
is, and that whatever proceeds from a good mind
and intention will be acceptable, and so I write
you this letter.”</p>

<p>The gentle boy, not yet nine years old, was
soon to be put forward to represent the king.
Henry had grown so enormously stout that he
could not climb the stairs. After a while he could
no longer even walk about his room, and he had
to be moved in a rolling chair. Commissioners
from the king of France were coming to England
to arrange terms of peace. The king ordered his
son to take his place.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” reported the officer in whose
charge the child had been, “truly, never was there
a prince of such courtesy and amiability. His
Grace rode on the charger most gallantly, and led
the two thousand knights and nobles with as
much of ease and stateliness of demeanor as if he
had been forty years of age.”</p>

<p>“And did he speak as he was taught?” asked
the king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
“Surely, your Majesty, and with such grace
and sovereignty in his manner that men were affected
even to tears.”</p>

<p>“And what said the admiral?”</p>

<p>“I verily believe, your Highness, that he would
have caught up the prince’s Grace and clasped
him to his breast had it not been for the dignity
of his Grace’s manner and bearing. He put his
arm about the neck of his Grace, but it was a
kiss of affection and not of state that he gave.”</p>

<p>“And after that?”</p>

<p>“After the speech of welcome, my lord prince
again took the head of the cavalcade. Never before
the time of your Majesty have they been
handled by such a leader. He led the French
away from the Heath to meet your Highness’s
gracious welcome at the palace.”</p>

<p>The boy was not spoiled by all this honor and
praise, but went willingly away from the glories
of the court to stay with his beloved sister Elizabeth.
Less than a year were they together, and
then it was thought best for them to be separated.
Edward was but a lonely little child in spite of
his stateliness when on the great charger, and he
grieved so for his sister that she wrote to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
suggesting that they write frequent letters to
each other. The boy caught eagerly at the idea.
“Nothing can now occur to me more grateful
than your letters,” he wrote in the prim, stilted
fashion of the day, and he added, “It is a comfort
to my regret that I hope shortly to see you
again if no accident intervenes.” He did see
her again before many weeks had passed, for
there was news to tell which the councilors wished
both children to hear.</p>

<p>King Henry had been growing more and more
feeble. For some time before his death, it was
so difficult for him to sign his name that three
men, acting together, were given the right to
do it for him. Two made an impression of his
signature with a dry stamp, and the third traced
the letters with ink. Henry grew no less bitter in
his enmity to all who opposed him, and one of
his last acts was to order the execution of his
aunt’s husband.</p>

<p>One winter day two men galloped swiftly over
the road to the palace which was then the home
of Edward.</p>

<p>“Inform his Highness that the Duke of Somerset
and Sir Anthony Brown await his pleasure,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
was the message brought to the prince. The Duke
of Somerset was Edward’s mother’s brother, and
he went eagerly to meet his guests.</p>

<p>“I rejoice that you bring me word of his
Majesty,” said the boy. “Is it not yet his will
that I should come to him?”</p>

<p>“Your Grace,” answered the Duke, “his Majesty
sent no such message, but he would that
you go with us to the home of her Grace, the
Lady Elizabeth.” The prince did not question a
command that was so in accordance with his
wishes, and they set off on horseback.</p>

<p>When the children were together, the duke
bowed low before the boy of ten years, his own
nephew, and <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Your Majesty, graciously permit your faithful
servants to kiss your hand and to promise you
their humblest obedience both now and ever. A
grievous duty is it, indeed, to declare to you that
our illustrious king, Henry VIII., no more governs
this realm of England. There is comfort for
his sorrowing subjects in the thought that he has
left us so noble and gracious a prince to rule us
in his stead.”</p>

<p>Edward had known nothing but kindness from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
his father, and now that the king was dead, Elizabeth
no longer remembered what he had made
her suffer. Edward forgot that he was a king,
and the children threw themselves into each
other’s arms and sobbed and cried until those who
were about them wept for sympathy.</p>

<p>Now the king had died three days before, but
lest there should be some insurrection or an attempt
to put Mary on the throne, the Duke of
Somerset and others who meant to be the real
rulers of the reign of Edward kept the news of
his death a secret until they could get the young
king safely into their hands and could establish
the government in his name. Edward was conducted
to the royal apartments in the Tower of
London with an honorable escort of troops and
nobles. There was great blowing of trumpets
and waving of banners, and the boy was proclaimed
king of England, France, and Ireland,
and supreme head of the church in England and
Ireland. A few weeks later the coronation took
place, and then there was a rejoicing indeed.
The streets through which the young king rode
were hung with tapestry and banners. Here and
there booths, or stages had been built, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
them all sorts of games and plays were carried
on to amuse the people. A rope was stretched
from the steeple of St. Paul’s church and fastened
firmly to a great anchor lying on the ground.
An acrobat contrived to creep halfway up this
rope, “aided neither by hand nor by foot,” the
old account says. Then he performed many feats
in mid-air, “whereat,” as the story puts it, “king
and nobles had good pastime.”</p>

<p>There was no longer a cruel king on the throne,
but a child who is described as a marvel of goodness
and learning. He is praised not only for
his ability to speak different languages, but for
his knowledge of geography. One of the historians
of the day said that he could recite all
the harbors and creeks in England, France, and
Scotland, and could tell what kind of entrance
there was in each for ships, and even which tides
and winds were most favorable. It was claimed,
too, that he knew the names of all the men of
authority in his kingdom, where their homes
were, and what their religion was.</p>

<p>This matter of religion was dividing the kingdom.
Henry had called himself a Catholic, but
he would not admit the Pope’s authority. Edward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
and Elizabeth had been brought up in their
father’s belief. The Duke of Somerset was one
of the men chosen to carry out Henry’s will, and
he was so decided a Protestant that he was almost
as determined to make every one accept
the Protestant faith as Henry had been to make
all his people agree with himself. In spite of all
King Henry’s declarations that neither Mary nor
Elizabeth should ever wear the crown, he had
finally willed that it should descend first to Edward,
then to Mary and then to Elizabeth. The
Catholics were eager to have Mary come to the
throne, because she was of their own faith; but
the Duke of Somerset had been chosen Protector,
that is, he was really to govern the kingdom until
Edward was old enough to rule, and he meant
to oblige the people to become Protestants.</p>

<p>There was even more scheming going on around
the boy king, for his councilors were already
planning for his marriage. A little five-year-old
girl in Scotland was the one whose hand they
meant to secure for their sovereign. Her name
was Mary, and she was the Queen of Scots. This
plan had been one of King Henry’s favorite
schemes, but it had never pleased the Scotch. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
Protector led an army against them, a most remarkable
fashion of winning a bride for the
young king, but the Scotch would not yield.</p>

<p>“What greater honor do you expect for the
queen?” demanded the English council. “How
can Scotland gain more sure protection than that
of the king of England?” The Scotch knew very
well that if Edward married Mary, it would be
for the purpose of gaining a surer control of
Scotland, and they refused in spite of the Duke
of Somerset and all his army. They betrothed
the little queen to the son of the French king,
and sent her to France to be educated. “The
Scotch are a perverse and wilful people,” then
said the English.</p>

<p>Besides the difficulty in gaining a wife for the
king and the religious persecutions, there was
trouble from other causes, especially among
the poor. Part of this arose from what was
called “enclosing.” On every great estate there
had always been land that the poor people living
on the estate could use as a common pasture for
their cows. The rich landowners were beginning
to “enclose,” or fence in these tracts of land and
to use them either for private parks or for sheep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
pastures. The poor had no longer any way to
feed their animals, and they were in great distress.
Somerset tried to forbid this enclosing,
but the owners of land were too powerful for
him, and the enclosing went on in spite of the
strictest laws against it. Indeed, the laws caused
a new difficulty, for now that the poor people had
a decree in their favor, they revolted in several
districts, and tried to seize the land. A writer
who lived in those times says, “The poor people
swarmed in the realm.”</p>

<p>Of course when there were revolts, Somerset
was obliged to suppress them, no matter how
much he sympathized with the revolters, and
often accused men were punished with little effort
to make sure of their guilt. It is said that a
miller who had been a revolter suspected that he
was in danger, and said to his servant, “I must
go away on business. If anyone asks for me
say that you are the miller and have owned the
mill these three years.” The king’s officer came
as the miller feared. “Are you the miller?”
he demanded. “Surely,” replied the servant
proudly. “The mill has been mine for three full
years.” “You have been a busy rebel,” declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
the officer, “and now you shall be hanged to the
nearest tree.” “Indeed, I’m not the miller, but
only his man,” cried the frightened servant.
“The man tells two tales, hang him up,” bade the
officer. A little later one who knew the miller
said, “Truly, he was not the miller, he was but
the miller’s man.” “Then has he proved a good
servant,” declared the officer contentedly, “for
how could he have done his master better service
than by hanging for him?”</p>

<p>The nobles were angry at Somerset’s attempt
to prevent enclosing, and they were indignant
that he should have so much power. The result
was that he was accused of treason and the Duke
of Northumberland became Protector.</p>

<p>Although all these acts were done in the name
of Edward, the boy king had really very little
freedom. “He is not alone half a quarter of an
hour,” said one who knew of his life. When he
first became king, he wrote to Mary, “I will be
to you a dearest brother and overflowing with
all kindness;” but he was taught by Somerset
and others that it was a danger to the kingdom
to allow his sister to remain a Catholic. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
he had been on the throne for about three years,
she was summoned to court.</p>

<p>“Your Highness,” said the chamberlain to
Edward, “I have to announce the arrival of her
Grace, the Princess Mary.”</p>

<p>“Give welcome to her and her train,” said the
young monarch, “and say that it is my will and
that of my councilors to receive her straightway.”
This visit was not for the pleasure of meeting
her brother, though they greeted each other most
cordially. The royal council was sitting in another
room, and there she was summoned.</p>

<p>“Your Grace,” said the councilors, “is it true
that, contrary to the wishes of his Majesty the
king, mass is still said daily in your house?”</p>

<p>“It is true,” answered Mary, “that the worship
of God is carried on in my house in such wise
as I do firmly believe is most pleasing to him.”</p>

<p>“There is then no hope of your Grace’s amendment
shortly?”</p>

<p>“None, my lord.”</p>

<p>“It is the will of his Majesty, who is supreme
head of the church in England, that the
mass should be no longer celebrated in his realm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
It becomes the duty of all that owe him allegiance
to obey. It is his Majesty’s command that you
obey as a subject, attempting not to rule as a
sovereign.”</p>

<p>“I will neither change my faith nor conceal
that which is my true opinion,” declared the princess,
“and in testimony of my belief I am ready
to lay my head upon the block for the truth,
though I am unworthy to suffer death in so good
a cause.”</p>

<p>Mary soon left the palace. Letters bidding
her give up her religion came from the king,
but the elder sister <span class="locked">replied:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“They may be signed with your own name,
but they cannot be really your own, for it is not
possible that your Highness can at these years
be a judge in matters of religion, and by the
doings of certain of your councilors I mean not
to rule my conscience.”</p>

<p>With his councilors telling him how dangerous
it was to the peace of the kingdom for Mary
to be allowed to practise a form of religion that
was contrary to the law, the brother and sister
can hardly have been very happy together, and
their meetings grew further apart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
Elizabeth was living quietly in her own house,
spending most of her time in study. The boy
king was hardly more than a toy in the hands
of his councilors. Somerset was finally condemned
to death, but when he wrote to Elizabeth
and begged her to appeal to the king and save
his life, Elizabeth was obliged to <span class="locked">answer:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The king is surrounded by those who take
good care to keep me away from him, and I can no
more gain access to his Majesty than you can.”</p>

<p>The one who was keeping Elizabeth from her
brother was the new Protector, the Duke of
Northumberland. Edward became ill, and everyone
knew that his life would be short. Elizabeth
tried to visit him, but was prevented. Then she
wrote him a letter, but it is not probable that he
ever saw it. Northumberland was in power, and
he did not mean that either Mary or Elizabeth
should wear the English crown; he had quite
another plan in his mind.</p>

<span class="subhead">GIVING AWAY A KINGDOM</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Edward</span> was not fifteen when the Duke of
Northumberland became Protector. At
eighteen the boy king was to be really
king and to govern his kingdom as he chose,
but until then, although everything was done in
his name, it was the Protector who would rule.
Northumberland thought that in those three years
he could gain so great an influence over the
young sovereign that even when the time came to
give up the high office, he would still retain much
of his power.</p>

<p>Edward had never been strong, and before
many months had passed, it was clear that he
would not live to be eighteen. Northumberland
had no mind to lose his power. What could he
do?</p>

<p>One morning in June he went to the chamber
of the king. Edward lay by the window looking
out into the bright sunshine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
“My humble greeting to your gracious Majesty,”
said Northumberland. “I have brought
news that cannot fail to give to your Highness an
increase of health and strength.”</p>

<p>“I think that nothing can do that,” said Edward,
“but good news will at least make the day
less weary. What is it that you have to tell?”</p>

<p>“That two of those followers of the Pope who
have most strongly opposed your Majesty’s efforts
for the good of the land have at last accepted
godly counsel.”</p>

<p>“I rejoice,” said the king. “Would that the
Princess Mary were one of them. Is it true, my
lord, that no word of submission to him who is
rightly the supreme head of the church in England
has come from her Grace?”</p>

<p>“It is true, your Highness.”</p>

<p>“Then when I die&mdash;no, my lord, do not deny
it. I know well that few days are left to me&mdash;my
sister will be on the throne. She will bring
back the falseness of the old religion. Not the
sovereign but the Pope will rule in the land, and
I can do nothing to prevent it. How little power
a king has!” Northumberland’s heart beat fast.
Now was his opportunity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
“Has your Majesty considered that the rightful
heirs of king as well as of subject are those
whom he himself shall name?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean, my lord, that it is my right
to name her who shall follow me? that I could
leave the crown to her Grace, the Princess Elizabeth,
if I would?”</p>

<p>“Our glorious ruler, Henry VIII., bequeathed
his crown as he would have it to descend. Surely,
it would be in your Majesty’s power to leave it
to the Princess Elizabeth’s Grace or to whomever
of the descendants of the illustrious sovereign,
King Henry VII., your Majesty might choose.”</p>

<p>“The Princess Elizabeth was taught the principles
of the truth even as I myself was,” mused
the king.</p>

<p>“True, your Majesty,” agreed the duke, “but
she is only twenty years of age. It might easily
come to pass that she would wed a foreign prince
of the false faith, and that the land, now so favored
with the light of truth, would be again
plunged into darkness. If she were already wed,
it would be safer, though many in the realm believe
that neither of the daughters of King Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
can rightfully inherit the crown. An heir upon
whom all must unite would save strife and it may
be bloodshed.”</p>

<p>“That might well be,” said the king thoughtfully.
Then Northumberland suggested boldly,
though with some inward <span class="locked">fear:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The sisters of your Majesty’s illustrious
father, could you&mdash;&mdash;” the duke hesitated.</p>

<p>“The granddaughter of Margaret Tudor is
the Queen of Scots, the little maiden who refused
my hand,” said the king with a faint smile,
“but she is of the false faith. The granddaughter
of Mary Tudor is my old playmate, the
lady Jane Grey, or is she not now Lady Dudley,
my lord? Was it not a few days ago that she became
the wife of your son? She is well-principled
in the truth.”</p>

<p>“Do not fancy, I beg your Highness, that a
thought of what your Majesty had in mind moved
me to look with favor upon the mutual affection
of the young couple.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the young king a little wearily.
“Arrange it in any way that you will to have
the kingdom fall into the hands of her who will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
lead it more fully into the light, and bear it further
from the idolatrous worship of the earlier
days.”</p>

<p>Northumberland had obtained his wish, but
there must be lawyers to write a deed of gift of
the crown. He went to three judges of the realm
and gave them the king’s command.</p>

<p>“Gladly would we see the faith of his Majesty
more fully established,” they said, “but, my
lord duke, in the time of King Henry Parliament
decreed that whoever did aught to change the
order of succession to the crown should suffer
death as a traitor.”</p>

<p>Northumberland persuaded and threatened,
but the judges had no mind to run the risk of losing
their heads for the sake of setting his
daughter-in-law upon the throne of England.</p>

<p>“If you had the written pardon of the king,
would you do it?” demanded Northumberland,
and after much discussion the judges hesitatingly
agreed. Edward was now as eager as the Protector
to have it made sure that Lady Jane would
ascend the throne, and he willingly signed a pardon
to free them from all punishment, if they
were ever accused of breaking the law of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
land. The pardon was signed, then the deed of
gift, bequeathing the crown to Lady Jane, was
signed. The dying king rejoiced, but the bold
schemer trembled.</p>

<p>There were very good reasons why each of
four women had a right to feel honestly that she
alone ought to be queen of England. These
four were Mary, Elizabeth, Mary, the child
Queen of Scots, who was descended from Margaret,
sister of Henry VIII., and last, Lady Jane,
who was descended from his youngest sister
Mary. According to King Henry’s will, which
Parliament had confirmed, the crown was to go to
Lady Jane, if Henry’s three children died without
heirs. It seemed quite possible that she might
some day be the ruler of England, and her parents
set to work to prepare her to become a queen.</p>

<p>Now when less than a century ago a lady in
England found that her little daughter Victoria
would probably be the sovereign of her country,
she said, “I want you to be a good woman,
and then I shall be sure that you will be a good
queen.” Lady Jane’s parents thought more of
training her to do everything according to the
etiquette of the court, and they were so anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
that she should walk and talk and sit and eat and
dance precisely as they thought a queen ought to
perform those acts, that they were exceedingly
severe with her. She was a gentle, loving girl,
and she did her best to satisfy them, but she was
upbraided and pinched and struck whenever she
was in their presence. The one great pleasure in
her life was the time that she spent with her
teacher, whom she called “Master Aylmer,” for
he was so kind to her and so gentle in all his
ways that she was happy when the hour of study
had arrived.</p>

<p>Everyone knew that Northumberland was the
most powerful man in the kingdom, and when
he said to Lady Jane’s father, the Marquis of
Dorset, “If you will give your daughter to my
son Guilford to wife, I will persuade the king to
make you a duke,” the marquis was delighted.
Lady Jane was but sixteen and Lord Guilford
Dudley was only one year older. They were married
at once with the most brilliant festivities.</p>

<p>Not many days after the wedding, King Edward
became very ill. “Hold yourself in readiness
for what may be demanded of you,” said
Northumberland to Lady Jane. “Should the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
king fail to recover, you are made by his Majesty
heir of his realm.”</p>

<p>The girl of sixteen had never thought of such
a thing as becoming queen of England until
many years should have passed, and probably not
even then, and she was greatly troubled. She
dared not disobey Northumberland, and when a
few days later he sent his daughter to bring her
to the royal council, she did not venture to refuse.
When the duke and the other members of
the council entered the room, they fell on their
knees before her and kissed her hand.</p>

<p>“We make our humble submission to your
Majesty as our sovereign lady and rightful ruler
of this realm of England,” said they.</p>

<p>Lady Jane was much abashed, and she <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“My lords, I can but thank you for the grace
that you show to one who is so unworthy of such
honor; but if I understand your words aright, you
greet me as your sovereign lady and ruler. My
lords, there is surely some grievous error. His
Majesty, King Edward, is, happily, still on the
throne, and even if it had pleased God to remove
his Grace from earth to heaven, no claim have I
so long as the Princesses Mary and Elizabeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
live. Will your lordships grant me permission
to withdraw?”</p>

<p>Then spoke the Duke of <span class="locked">Northumberland:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Your Majesty and members of the royal
council, it is a painful duty that falls to my lot
to announce the death of our beloved and illustrious
king, Edward VI. Much reason have we
to rejoice not only in his praiseworthy life and
his countless acts of goodness and clemency, but
especially in that he, being at the close of his
days, thought most earnestly upon the welfare
of his realm. In his last hour on earth he prayed
that his kingdom might be defended from the
popish faith, and he left it in the hands of her
who he believed would be faithful to the trust,
and would guard the land from falsehood and
from error.”</p>

<p>All her life Lady Jane had known and loved
the young king. Tears came to her eyes. She
looked pitifully about the room. Several noble
ladies had been brought into the council chamber,
but not one had even a glance of sympathy for the
young girl. The Duchess of Northumberland
frowned at her, and her own mother whispered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
sternly, “Demean yourself as is fitting for a
queen.”</p>

<p>“His Majesty gave command to his council,”
said the duke, “and they have no choice save to
obey him. Thus declares the will of the king,
signed and sealed, and drawn up by three capable
judges of the realm. It names as his heir and
successor on the throne of England her gracious
Highness, Lady Jane, descendant of Mary, who
was the youngest and most beloved sister of his
Majesty, King Henry VIII.”</p>

<p>Then all the lords of the council knelt at the
feet of Lady Jane. “We render to your Majesty
only the honor that is due,” said they, “for you
are of true and direct lineage heir to the crown.
With deliberate mind we have promised to his
Highness, King Edward VI., that in your Grace’s
cause we will spare neither goods nor lands nor
the shedding of our blood.”</p>

<p>Lady Jane stood before them, white and trembling.
Then grief and pain overcame her, and
with a sudden burst of tears she fell to the ground.
When she was a little recovered, she said to
<span class="locked">them:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
“My lords, I can but grieve from my heart for
the death of so noble a prince and one that was
so dear to me. I am weak and feeble. I have
little power to govern the land as he in his greatness
of mind and of heart would have done,
but if that which you say has been given me is
rightfully and lawfully mine own, then will I
turn to God in my insufficiency and humbly beseech
his grace and spirit that I may rule the
land to its advantage and to his glory and
service.”</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the same day Lady Jane
went in state to the Tower of London, for it was
an old custom that sovereigns should go forth from
the Tower on the day of their coronation. Her
relatives knelt before her and humbly promised
to be obedient to her commands; and her own
mother walked meekly behind her, bearing the
daughter’s train. In the evening she was proclaimed
in London ruler of the kingdom. There
was little rejoicing. The people as a whole were
sullen and silent, for most of them understood
that the affair was but a scheme of Northumberland’s
to gain power for himself.</p>

<div id="i66" class="figcenter" style="width: 481px;">

<div class="caption"><p>Lady Jane Grey and Roger Ascham.&mdash;<i>From painting by
J.&nbsp;C. Horsley.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The duke knew that if Mary and Elizabeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
were free after Edward’s death was known, a
party would be formed in favor of one or the
other, and therefore he had planned to get them
both into his hands. He sent messengers to them
to say that the king was very ill and begged that
they would give him the happiness and comfort of
their presence.</p>

<p>Elizabeth paid no heed to the message. Either
she was really ill, as she said, or she was wise
enough to suspect that there was some trickery
about this sudden demand for her society, when
for so long a time she had not been allowed to
see her brother. At any rate, she remained in her
own house.</p>

<p>Mary returned word by a swift rider that she
was made very happy by the thought that she
could help to bring cheer and consolation to her
brother, and she set out at once to go to him.
When she was only a few miles from London, a
man who had been her goldsmith came riding in
hot haste.</p>

<p>“Your Grace,” he said, “I beg that you will
go no farther. The king is not ill, he is dead.
Northumberland plans to set Lady Jane upon
the throne. Flee, I do pray you.” Mary hesitated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Was the word of the goldsmith true?
Whom could she trust? Should she go on to
London and perhaps be thrown into the prison
of the Tower by Northumberland? Should she
flee to Norfolk and refuse, it might be, her
brother’s last tender wishes? Was it a trap to
make her declare herself queen and then behead
her for treason? While she questioned, another
rider came, a nobleman whom she trusted, and
he told her that the king was indeed dead.</p>

<p>Mary turned toward Norfolk. Night came on.
The princess herself and many of her retinue
were exhausted. They asked for shelter at a
country-seat. It was given them, but the Protestants
in the neighborhood had heard that Edward
was dead and that the Catholic princess was
among them. A mob set out in the morning to
destroy the house that had sheltered her. Mary
had been warned of the danger and had ridden
away. She glanced back from the top of a hill
and saw the house in flames. “Let it go,” she
cried. “I will build him a better one.”</p>

<p>As soon as she reached her own castle in Norfolk,
she sent a letter to the royal council
<span class="locked">saying:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
“We are greatly surprised that we have had
from you no knowledge of the death of our
brother, but we trust your love and your loyalty.
Whatever may have been said to us of any disloyal
intentions on your part we do put far from
us, and do agree to grant you pardon and receive
you graciously into our service as true and faithful
subjects.”</p>

<p>Even though the councilors had failed to secure
Mary, they still believed that their side would
win, and they sent her a rather arrogant letter.
It <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Lady Jane is our queen, but if you will show
yourself quiet and obedient as you ought, you
will find us all ready to do you any service that
we with duty may.”</p>

<p>Mary then rode to Framlingham, a strongly
fortified castle some twenty miles away. It was
so near the sea that she could escape to the continent
if flight should become necessary, but she
could hardly have been in a safer place. The
walls of the stronghold were eight feet thick;
town and fortress were surrounded by three deep
moats. Here she flung out her banner and called
upon all loyal subjects to come to the assistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
of their rightful queen. So many thousands
gathered that she ventured to set out for London,
and as she drew near the city, she met such a
welcome that she disbanded her army.</p>

<p>Now at Edward’s death when Northumberland
saw that his plan to capture Elizabeth had
failed, he sent a messenger to promise her land
and money if she would but resign all title to
the crown. With rare wisdom for so young a
woman, she <span class="locked">replied:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“That is not for me to say. Lady Mary is
by my father’s will and by decree passed in open
Parliament the rightful queen of the realm.
Whatever my claim may be, I can make no challenge
so long as my sister doth live.” Elizabeth
then set out to meet Mary, and they entered
London together, followed by a long train
of ladies and noblemen, and escorted by the city
guard.</p>

<p>Northumberland too, had collected an army,
but his men deserted by hundreds. In less than
two months after he had triumphantly set his
daughter-in-law upon the throne, he was executed,
together with two of those who had most
strongly supported him. Lady Jane and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
husband were imprisoned. Mary’s advisers declared
that there was no safety for her so long as
Lady Jane lived, but Mary refused to put her to
death.</p>

<p>As the day for the coronation drew near, there
were great rejoicings. Many of those that did
not wish to have a Catholic ruler were so glad to
be free from Northumberland’s schemes and to
feel that she who was lawfully their queen was
now on the throne that they were ready to unite
in the joy of the others. In the procession to
the Tower, Queen Mary rode in a litter, or
chariot, drawn by six horses, glittering in their
trappings of cloth of silver. She was robed in
the richest of blue velvet, made even richer by
bands of ermine. She wore a sort of head-dress,
so heavy with gold and pearls and jewels that she
often had to hold up her head with her hands. In
a litter almost as splendid as her own rode Elizabeth
and her first stepmother, Anne of Cleves.
Noble ladies rode on horseback in all the splendors
of crimson velvet. Companies of guards followed
in white and green, the royal colors.</p>

<p>The next morning after all this magnificence,
there was such a brilliant display as made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
gorgeousness of the ride through the city seem
simple and modest, for the queen was to be
crowned in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>When she was on the platform in full view of
the people, the Bishop of Winchester demanded
of them whether it was their will that the crown
should be placed on the head of the most excellent
princess, Mary, eldest daughter of King
Henry VIII. The people shouted, “Yea, yea!
Queen Mary, Queen Mary!” Mary made a
solemn promise to govern England aright and
faithfully preserve the liberties of the people.
Then followed all kinds of ceremonies, changing
of robes, and sounding of trumpets. She was
girded with a sword, a ring was put upon her
finger, and at last the crown was solemnly placed
upon her head. This was by no means the end of
it all, for many nobles came to kneel before her
and promise to be true to her. Each one of them
kissed her cheek.</p>

<p>In all this ceremonial as well as in the feasting
and the entertainments that followed it, the Princess
Elizabeth was in every way ranked next to
the queen. Elizabeth wore the coronet of a princess.
“It is very heavy,” she whispered to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
French ambassador. “Be patient,” murmured
he, “it will be parent to a better one.”</p>

<p>Parliament was soon in session, and one of
the important questions to be decided was what
should be done with Lady Jane.</p>

<p>“She attempted to seize the crown from Mary,
who is our rightful sovereign,” declared one,
“and she should be put to death as a traitor.”</p>

<p>“What she did was done at the bidding of the
Duke of Northumberland,” said another. “She
was but a tool in his hands, and she should be
freed.”</p>

<p>“That cannot well be,” objected a third.
“Whoever commits a crime is guilty of that crime
and must bear the punishment.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed the first, “and moreover, some
who would question Elizabeth’s right to the
throne would perchance unite under the banner
of Jane. There will be neither rest nor safety
in the kingdom so long as she is spared to lead
any rebellious faction that may need a head.”</p>

<p>Parliament decided that Lady Jane was guilty
of treason, and she was sentenced to be either
burned or beheaded as the queen should choose.
Everyone was sorry for her. Even those that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
condemned her could hardly look upon the young
girl without tears, and when she was taken back
to her prison in the Tower, crowds of weeping
people followed her.</p>

<p>“She is to be put to death ‘at the queen’s
pleasure,’” said one royal attendant to another.
“Do you believe it will be soon?”</p>

<p>“He who dwells in a palace should see but not
speak,” answered the other. “To you, however,
I may venture to whisper that the death of Lady
Jane will never be ‘the queen’s pleasure.’”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span></p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="subhead">A PRINCESS IN PRISON</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Mary</span> did not forget to show gratitude
to those who had aided her in gaining
possession of her crown. To some
she gave high positions, and for the one whose
house had been burned she built a much finer
residence.</p>

<p>“And now, my well-beloved cousin and councilor,”
she said to the Earl of Sussex, “we would
gladly show to you our hearty appreciation of
your loyalty in a troublous time. Ask what you
will of us, and it shall be granted.”</p>

<p>The only way of heating houses in those days
was by means of fireplaces, and therefore, even
the royal palaces were full of chills and drafts.
Whenever the earl came to court, he took cold.
A thought struck him and he <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“If your Grace is really of intent to bestow
upon me the gift that will give me most of comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
and peace of mind and body, I would beg
humbly for the royal permission that I need no
longer uncover my head before man or woman.”</p>

<p>Mary was greatly amused. “Either cap or coif
or nightcap [skullcap] may you wear,” said she,
“and woe to the one that dares to dispute your
privilege.” The next morning a parchment bearing
the royal arms was presented to the earl
with all formality. It <span class="locked">read:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Know ye that we do give to our well-beloved
and trusty councilor, Henry, Earl of Sussex, license
and pardon to wear his cap, coif, or nightcap,
or any two of them, at his pleasure, as well
in our presence as in the presence of any other
person within this our realm.”</p>

<p>Not all the questions of the day were settled
as easily. One of the most important ones was
who should succeed Mary on the throne. If
she married and had children, they would be her
heirs, but if not, the Princess Elizabeth would
probably follow her as ruler of England. Now
Mary was a strong and sincere Catholic, and her
dearest wish was to lead England back to the
old faith and have the Pope acknowledged as the
head of the English church. She hoped to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
able to bring this to pass, but she was not well,
she had little reason to look for a long life, and
when Elizabeth became queen, all Mary’s work
would be undone, the land would be again Protestant.
Elizabeth was to Mary still the little
sister whom she had so often led by the hand.
Would it not be possible to persuade her to become
a Catholic? Elizabeth had loved Edward,
would she not go with Mary to hear a mass for
the repose of his soul? Elizabeth refused. Again
Mary asked, and again Elizabeth said no.</p>

<p>“She would not dare be so bold if stronger
than herself were not behind her,” declared
Mary’s councilors. “There is danger to life and
throne in this audacity.” Others too were to be
feared, those Protestants who did not believe in
the right of Elizabeth to the crown. They were
not sorry to see disagreement between the two
sisters, for if the younger should be shut out from
the succession, Lady Jane, prisoner in the Tower
as she was, would be accepted as Mary’s heir.
Evidently Elizabeth must be induced to become a
Catholic if it was possible. Mary begged and
then she threatened. She had sermons preached
before Elizabeth, and she sent the royal councilors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
to talk with her, but in vain. At last the
princess was made to understand that she must
yield or withdraw from court. More than this,
it was said to her, “There are suspicions that
you are bold in resisting the queen because you
have support from without.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth was alarmed, and she sent a message
to the <span class="locked">queen:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I pray you, let us meet, there is much that I
would say.” Soon the meeting came to pass.
Mary entered the room attended by only one
lady, who followed her at a greater distance than
was customary. Elizabeth threw herself at
Mary’s feet and said with many <span class="locked">tears:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Most gracious queen and sister, I have ever
looked up to you with love and respect, and since
I have had the use of my reason, I have been interested
in everything that concerns your greatness
and glory. It grieves me to the heart to
feel that for some reason unknown to myself I am
no longer as dear to your Majesty as I have believed
myself to be.”</p>

<p>“My well-beloved sister,” answered the queen,
“gladly would I show to you all affection if I
were but sure that your heart was turned toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
me and toward that which is not only my dearest
wish but is for the salvation of your own soul.”</p>

<p>“I have but followed the belief in which I was
brought up,” said Elizabeth. “Such books as
my father approved have been my reading. I
will study others if you will, and it may be that
my mind will be opened to perceive truth in doctrines
wherein I had not thought it to lie.”</p>

<p>“It will be a pleasure to my chaplain to choose
for you those that are of such quality as to lead
a truly inquiring heart into the way of right.”</p>

<p>“Yet another kindness do I beg of you, my
queen and sister,” said Elizabeth. “I have
listened to those whom I was told to hear. Will
your Grace send to me some well-taught preacher
to instruct me in the way wherein you would have
me to walk? Never have I heard any learned
doctor discourse in such wise as to show me
where lay my error.” Mary agreed, and a few
days later the two sisters attended mass together.
Elizabeth even wrote to the German emperor that
she intended to have a Catholic chapel opened in
her own house, and asked his permission to purchase
in Flanders a cross, chalice, and such ornaments
as would be needed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
No one had much confidence in her sudden
change of creed. Those Protestants who were
discontented went on with their plots to make her
queen, convinced none the less that once on the
throne, she would restore the Protestant form of
worship. The German emperor, who was Mary’s
chief adviser, urged that to insure the queen’s
safety Elizabeth ought to be imprisoned, or at
any rate, so strictly guarded that she could do
no harm. There was reason for his fears.
Mary, Queen of Scots, would soon become the
daughter-in-law of the French king, and while
he was pretending to be a true friend to Elizabeth,
he was in reality doing all in his power
to make trouble between her and Mary. If Elizabeth
could be led into some plot that would anger
Mary and so could be shut out from the succession,
his daughter-in-law might easily become
queen of England as well as of Scotland. Vague
rumors of discontent and plots came to the ears
of Mary, and for some time she refused Elizabeth’s
request to be allowed to go to her own
house.</p>

<p>The German emperor was Mary’s cousin,
Charles V., to whom she had been betrothed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
when she was a child. He was seventeen years
older than she, and was the most powerful sovereign
in Europe. To him she went for counsel
concerning the difficult questions that pressed
upon her. The most urgent one was that of her
proposed marriage. She was to marry, that was
settled, but the bridegroom had not yet been
selected. No fewer than four foreign princes
were suggested, but the English hoped most
earnestly that she would marry an Englishman.
Charles V. seemed to favor first one and then another,
but he could always give good reasons why
no one of them should be the chosen one. At last
he named his own son Philip. Mary made many
objections.</p>

<p>“The emperor is also king of Spain,” said she
to Charles’s ambassador, “and when Philip succeeds
him on the Spanish throne, how can he
come and rule in England?”</p>

<p>“That matter would not be difficult to arrange,”
answered the ambassador. “The prince
could rule in Spain and dwell in England, even
as his father is able to rule both Spain and
Germany.”</p>

<p>“He is very young,” said she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
“He is a staid man,” declared the ambassador.
“He has often had to stand in responsible positions,
and indeed in appearance he is already
many years older than your Majesty.”</p>

<p>“When I marry, I shall marry as a woman,
not as a queen,” said Mary, “and I shall promise
to obey my husband, but it will be my right to
rule my kingdom. No foreigner may have part
or lot in that. The English people would not
bear it, nor would they endure to have places of
honor or of power given to foreigners.” Still,
she did not reject Philip.</p>

<p>It was soon whispered about that there was a
possibility of a Spanish marriage. The chancellor
came to the queen and begged her to make
no such alliance. “No other nation is so disliked
as the Spaniards,” said he, “and Philip’s haughtiness
and arrogance have disgusted his own subjects.
Philip will rule the Low Countries, and
the king of France will never endure it to have the
Netherlands fall into the hands of England.”</p>

<p>In spite of her objections Mary really favored
the marriage with Philip. He was her cousin,
of her own faith, and of her mother’s nation.
With Philip to support her, she could bring England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
back to the old faith. She allowed Charles’s
ambassador to discuss the matter again.</p>

<p>“Your Highness,” said he, “never was a sovereign
in a more difficult position. You stand
alone without an honest adviser in the land. See
how easily your councilors who were Protestants
one year ago have now become Catholics. Will
they not as readily become Protestants again, if
they have good hope of farther advancement under
the Princess Elizabeth? You are surrounded
by enemies. There are those who do not love
the true church, and there are the rebels who
followed Northumberland; Lady Jane and the
Princess Elizabeth stand ready for their hand.
Then there are France and Scotland; the Scotch
queen would willingly add England to her domain.
In Spain lies your only hope.”</p>

<p>“Even if what you say is true,” she responded,
“I am not a young girl whose hand is to be disposed
of at the will of her father, I must see
the prince before I decide.”</p>

<p>“Pardon, your Majesty,” said the ambassador,
“but the emperor will never permit that his son
and heir should be exhibited before the court as
a candidate for your Majesty’s hand, and perchance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
be rejected before the eyes of Europe. A
man’s face is a token of the man, shall a portrait
of the prince be sent you?”</p>

<p>The queen agreed, and the picture was sent. It
portrayed a young man with blue eyes, yellow
hair and beard, and a rather gloomy expression;
but the face must have pleased the queen, for
when Parliament again begged her to marry none
but an Englishman, it was too late. Two days
earlier she had in the presence of the Spanish
ambassador taken a solemn oath that she would
wed no other man than Prince Philip of Spain.</p>

<p>Nothing was talked of in the kingdom but the
Spanish marriage.</p>

<p>“It is a poor business,” said one. “King
Henry is but seven years dead, and his kingdom
will soon be only a province of Spain.”</p>

<p>“Not so fast,” rejoined the other. “Spain is
the richest country in Europe. I wish I had but
the twentieth part of the gold that comes from
the New World in one of those high-decked galleons
of hers.”</p>

<p>“For the queen to marry Philip will bring it
no nearer to us,” retorted the first.</p>

<p>“Why not, my friend? Will not freedom to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
trade help to fill our empty treasury? Spain is
a strong ally. Let France and Scotland attack
us, and it will be well to have a helper with ships
and treasure.”</p>

<p>“Ships and treasure will not give us freedom,”
declared the first. “Better be poor than be ruled
by Spain. I’m as true a Catholic as you, but no
wish have I to see the torture chamber of Spain
brought into England. Philip’s own subjects
detest him.”</p>

<p>Mary’s councilors soon ceased to oppose what
she so plainly wanted, though it was whispered
about that they were convinced by bribes rather
than by arguments. An ambassador came from
Spain to bring the engagement ring and to draw
up the marriage treaty. The English people were
angry and indignant, and the children played a
game called “English and Spaniards.” Philip
was one of the characters in this play, and there
was always a pretence of hanging him. Nevertheless,
the treaty was drawn up. It was agreed
that no Spaniards should hold office in England.
If the queen should have children, they must not
be carried out of the land without the consent
of the nobles, and they should inherit not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
England but the lands of Holland and Flanders
to which Philip was heir.</p>

<p>In spite of all these careful arrangements, the
English became more and more enraged, and
there were insurrections in various parts of the
country. One was headed by the Duke of Suffolk,
Lady Jane’s father. Mary had supposed
that if Suffolk was forgiven and his daughter
allowed to live, he would be loyal from gratitude,
but this was not the case. He went from one
place to another, raising troops and proclaiming
Lady Jane queen of the realm.</p>

<p>Another insurrection was headed by a young
poet named Wyatt. His forces came so near
London that the queen was in great danger.
Lawyers wore armor under their robes when they
pleaded in court, and clergymen wore armor
under their vestments when they preached. The
insurgents came nearer, and there was hot fighting.
“Flee, my queen, flee!” called one after
another, but Mary was perfectly calm and answered,
“I warrant we shall hear better news
anon.”</p>

<p>When it became clear that there would be
bloodshed, Mary had written to Elizabeth, telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
her of the danger and urging her to come
at once where she would be protected. “Assuring
you that you will be most heartily welcome,” the
letter ends. Elizabeth sent word that she was
ill and not able to travel. Many days passed, and
they were days full of events. The Duke of Suffolk
was captured.</p>

<p>“You have pardoned him once,” said Mary’s
councilors, “and his gratitude is but another attempt
to thrust you from the throne. This time
there can be no pardon.” Mary agreed. “There
is one thing more,” said they. “There will be
neither peace nor quiet nor safety in the land so
long as Lady Jane lives.”</p>

<p>“I can never sign the death warrant of my
cousin,” declared Mary, “not even to save my
own life.”</p>

<p>“Have you a right to shed the blood of your
subjects?” they demanded. “The ground about
us is wet with their blood. Shall such scenes
come to pass a second time?” Mary yielded, and
Lady Jane was beheaded.</p>

<p>A question even more difficult than this had
arisen. When Wyatt was examined, he declared
that the Princess Elizabeth had known of the plot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
Now Mary sent, not an affectionate invitation,
but a command for her sister’s presence. Two
physicians accompanied the commissioners. They
agreed that the princess was able to travel,
and the company set out for the court. One
hundred of her attendants escorted her, and one
hundred more of Mary’s guards followed. Elizabeth
was greatly loved by the masses of the
people. She was fine-looking, well educated, and
witty, and they were proud of their princess.</p>

<p>“Draw aside the curtains,” she commanded.
“Let the people see me if they will.” The people
saw her indeed. Crowds lined the road as the
procession moved slowly by.</p>

<p>“Alas, poor young lady,” sobbed one kind-hearted
woman. “I mind me well when her own
mother went to the block.”</p>

<p>“She’s over young to be facing the cruel
axe,” declared another. “She’s but the age of
my own girl, only one and twenty, if she <i>is</i> a
princess.”</p>

<p>“Mayhap it will all be well,” said a third.
“See her sitting there in the fair white gown,
and her face as white as the stuff itself. She’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
not the one to plot and plan to take the life of
the queen.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth came to the palace, but Mary refused
to meet her.</p>

<p>“Bear this ring to her Majesty,” commanded
the princess. It was much the custom in those
days for one friend to give another a ring whose
sight should renew their friendship if misunderstanding
had arisen between them, and Elizabeth
wore one that had been given her by Mary long
before. The pledge had lost its power, for Mary
sent only the message, “Before we can meet, you
must show your innocence of that of which you
are accused.”</p>

<p>Day after day it was debated what should be
done with the princess. Although just before
Wyatt’s death he had taken back his words of
accusation, the royal council still suspected her.
Charles V. was more than willing that she should
be put to death, and the Spanish ambassador told
Mary that until the punishment of the rebels had
made the realm safe for Philip, he could not land
on English soil. “It is most important,” said
he, “that the trial and execution of the Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
Elizabeth should take place before the arrival of
the prince.”</p>

<p>One morning ten of the royal commissioners
demanded audience of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Your Grace,” said the leader, “a grievous
charge is made against you, that you were knowing
to an evil and felonious attempt to overthrow
the government and take the life of our most
gracious queen. It is the pleasure of her Highness
that you be at once removed to the Tower.”</p>

<p>“I am an innocent woman,” Elizabeth answered,
“and I trust that her Majesty will be
far more gracious than to commit to the Tower
one who has never offended her in thought, word,
or deed. I beg you intercede for me with the
queen.”</p>

<p>The intercession was of no avail. Elizabeth
sent a letter to Mary denying all charges and
begging that they might meet, but the only reply
was the order, “Your Grace must away to the
Tower.”</p>

<p>“I am content, inasmuch as it is the queen’s
pleasure,” Elizabeth replied, and the carefully
guarded boat set off. It drew up, not at the door
which led to the royal apartments of the Tower,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
but at the one called the Traitors’ Gate, where
many a prisoner had been landed in the past
troublous times.</p>

<p>“I am no traitor,” said she, “nor will I go
in at the Traitors’ Gate.”</p>

<p>“Madam, there is no choice,” answered sternly
one of the commissioners, but he added kindly,
“The rain falls in torrents, will your Grace
honor me by making use of my cloak?” Elizabeth
flung it down angrily, and put her foot on
the step, covered with water as it was.</p>

<p>“Here lands as true a subject as ever landed
at these steps,” she declared solemnly. Up the
stairs she was taken, and to the room that was
to become her prison. The doors were locked and
bolted.</p>

<p>She was not without friends even within the
walls of the Tower. Both Mary and Elizabeth
were fond of children, and Elizabeth especially
could always win their hearts. She had not been
long a prisoner before one little girl, the child of
an officer, began to watch for her when she walked
in the garden.</p>

<p>“Lady,” asked the child, “do you like to be in
the Tower?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
“No, I do not,” answered Elizabeth, “but the
doors are locked and I have no key, so I cannot
go out.” In a few days the little girl came to
her with a beaming face. “I want to tell you
something,” she whispered. “I want to tell it
right into your ear.” She threw her arms around
the princess’s neck and whispered: “I’ve brought
you some keys so you needn’t always stay here.
Now you can open the gates and go out as you
will, can’t you?” and the child pulled from the
bosom of her frock some little keys that she had
found.</p>

<p>A boy of four years was one of her pets, and
used to bring her flowers every day. The council
suspected that he was bringing messages to her
from another prisoner in the Tower and ordered
his father to forbid his speaking to the princess.
Nevertheless, the little fellow watched at the
bolted door for a chance to say good-by, and
called softly, “Lady, I can’t bring you any
flowers, and I can’t come to see you any more.”</p>

<p>In those times executions followed accusations
so easily that Elizabeth was alarmed at every little
commotion, and one day she asked anxiously
whether the scaffold was still standing on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
Lady Jane had been executed. The princess, was
indeed, very near death at one time, for the
queen’s chancellor sent to the Tower an order for
her execution. Mary was very ill and not expected
to recover, and the chancellor may have thought
that only the death of Elizabeth could save England
for the Catholic church. The order was
delivered to the keeper of the Tower.</p>

<p>“Where is the signature of the queen?” he
demanded.</p>

<p>“The queen is too ill to sign the paper, but it
is sent in her name.”</p>

<p>“Then in her name will I wait until by the
blessing of God her Majesty shall be well again,
and can speak for herself,” returned the keeper.</p>

<p>When Mary had recovered, she was exceedingly
angry that the life of Elizabeth had been
so nearly taken. It was soon decided that the
princess should stay no longer in the Tower, but,
should be taken to the palace at Woodstock.</p>

<p>Elizabeth expected to be put to death. “Pray
for me,” she said to one of her servants, “for this
night I think I must die.” All along the way to
Woodstock the people flocked to gaze upon her.
They filled her litter with cakes and flowers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
sweet-smelling herbs. Every one saluted her.
“God save your Grace!” cried the crowds, and
in one little village the bells rang a hearty welcome
as she passed through. Nevertheless, she
was a prisoner and as closely guarded as she had
been in the Tower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="subhead">FROM PRISON TO THRONE</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">While</span> one sister was in prison, the
sister on the throne had not found life
altogether happy. The more she gazed
upon Philip’s picture, the more she longed to
meet him, but he made no haste in coming. Two
months had passed since Mary put on the betrothal
ring, and never yet had he even written
to her. Philip had begged his father to choose
a young wife for him, but to the emperor the
fact that Mary was ten years older than his son
was a small matter if only he could secure for
Philip a possibility of ruling England.</p>

<p>The marriage was to take place at Winchester,
and as the time drew near, Mary set out with
her retinue. She was borne in the royal litter,
and if all the vehicles were as gorgeous as the one
provided for her maids of honor, the procession
must have been a dazzling sight. This one was
a “wagon of timber work with wheels, axletrees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
and benches.” It was painted red, lined with red
buckram, and covered with red cloth. This covering
was adorned with heavy fringe of red silk.</p>

<p>Not at all agreeable was Philip’s journey to
Winchester. When he landed in England, he
found a great company of nobles waiting to do
him honor, and he was escorted to a palace in
which most beautiful rooms had been prepared
for him. This was pleasant, but when he set off
for Winchester, the wind blew and the rain came
down in floods, and the four or five thousand
riders in the procession were thoroughly
drenched.</p>

<p>Before they had ridden many minutes, a swift
messenger drew rein in front of the prince, presented
him a ring, and <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Her Majesty the queen doth send your Grace
this ring as a token that she would pray you to
advance no farther.”</p>

<p>Philip did not understand English perfectly.
“There is danger,” said he to his officers. “Little
welcome have I from these English.” It was
explained to him that the queen’s message only
meant that she begged him not to expose himself
to the storm, and he went on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
That evening the prince, all in black velvet and
diamonds, made his first call on the woman whom
he was to marry two days later. They talked together
in Spanish for half an hour, and the next
day they had another meeting, and Philip&mdash;now
in black velvet and silver&mdash;stood with the queen
under the canopy of state. She kissed him in
greeting, and they talked together before the hundreds
of ladies and nobles in the great audience
hall.</p>

<p>On the following day came the marriage, and
then there was such gleaming of pearls and blazing
of rubies and flashing of diamonds as one
might see in a splendid dream.</p>

<p>“Who giveth this woman to be married to this
man?” asked the archbishop, and four great
nobles of the kingdom came forward and answered,
“We do give her in the name of the
whole realm of England.” A plain gold ring
was put on the queen’s finger, for “I will marry
with a plain hoop of gold like any other maiden,”
she had said. The people shouted, “God save
our Queen! God send them joy!” and Mary of
England had become the wife of Philip of Spain.</p>

<p>While the wedding rejoicings were going on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
Elizabeth was a prisoner at Woodstock. What
was to be done with her was the question. There
was some reason to think that she had known of
the plot to dethrone the queen, and in any case,
if she was free, any leader of an insurrection
could have an opportunity to try to win her support.
Mary did not wish to keep her in the
Tower, and she thought of sending her to some
of her own Spanish relatives on the continent, but
the royal marriage helped to decide the question,
for Prince Philip expressed himself very decidedly
to his royal wife that it would be best to set Elizabeth
free.</p>

<p>“I would do it most gladly,” said Mary, “could
I be sure of her innocence.”</p>

<p>“Does not your English law claim that one is
innocent till he is proved guilty?”</p>

<p>“True,” replied Mary, “but there is proof and
there is no proof. My councilors declare that to
set her free will be to say that she has been unjustly
imprisoned.”</p>

<p>“Can she not be induced to confess that she
has done wrong and throw herself on your
mercy?”</p>

<p>“Never,” answered the queen quickly. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
have known her since she was a little child. When
she storms and rages, she will yield, but when
she quietly persists, she stands firm. I will see
her. Nothing do I long for more than to believe
that she is guiltless.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth was sent for, and late one evening
she had an audience with the queen. The younger
sister knelt with her eyes full of tears and
<span class="locked">sobbed:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I beg your Majesty to believe in my truth
and loyalty, no matter who shall say to the contrary.”</p>

<p>“Then you will not confess,” returned Mary.
“You persist in declaring that you are innocent.”</p>

<p>“If I am not innocent,” said Elizabeth
solemnly, “never again will I ask favor or kindness
from the hands of your Grace.”</p>

<p>“God knows,” murmured the queen half turning
away. A minute later she said, “Elizabeth,
will you swear by all that you do hold sacred that
you have no guilt in this matter?”</p>

<p>“I will,” answered Elizabeth without a moment’s
hesitation.</p>

<p>“Then do I forgive you&mdash;be you innocent or
be you guilty,” she said to herself&mdash;“and in token<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
of my pardon I restore to you the ring, pledge of
my sisterly affection. May the time never come
when you will have need to send it to me again.”</p>

<p>At Christmas there was a grand round of festivities
at court. The Pope had sent a representative
to receive from Mary the humble submission
of the kingdom, and the rejoicings were looked
upon not only as celebrating this reconciliation
but as in some measure continuing those of the
queen’s marriage. Elizabeth was made prominent
in everything. She sat at the queen’s table and
was treated as heir to the throne. Nevertheless,
Mary did not fully trust her, and when the princess
was about to return to her own home, the
queen presented a nobleman and said that henceforth
he would abide in Elizabeth’s house, charged
with the duty of guarding her safety and comfort.
This nobleman was a learned and upright man of
most perfect courtesy, and his presence can hardly
have failed to give her pleasure, even though
Elizabeth well knew that he was sent to make
sure that she had no connection with any of the
plots which were to be feared.</p>

<p>It is no wonder that a close watch needed to
be kept for conspiracies, for several were formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
against the queen. A story was spread abroad
that Edward VI. was not dead, but was living in
France and was about to return to regain his
throne. There were rumors that certain men in
the land had the power of magic, and had stuck
pins into waxen images of the queen, thereby
causing her intense suffering. The king of
France was ready to encourage any rumor, however
absurd, and to aid any conspiracy that would
better the chances of Mary of Scotland to wear
the crown of England. If Elizabeth was dead
or shut out of the succession, these chances would
be greatly increased, and probably this is why
Philip had now become the friend of Elizabeth,
for if France and Scotland and England were
united, his own power and that of his father
would be much less. Several foreign husbands
were proposed for the princess, one of them the
son of Philip by a former marriage, a boy of
ten years. Elizabeth refused them all, and the
queen declared that she should not be forced to
marry against her will.</p>

<p>Mary’s reign was shamed and disgraced by
the burning of a large number of persons, two
hundred at least, because their religious belief differed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
from that which she thought right. She
is called “Bloody Mary” because this took place
in her reign, but just how far she was in fault
no one knows. Neither Henry VIII. nor Edward
nor Mary ever showed the least regard for the
physical sufferings of others, but Mary had never
manifested the least vindictiveness of disposition.
Indeed, she had often been more inclined
than her councilors thought best to pardon and
overlook deeds that most rulers of the time would
have punished. Moreover, during some of the
worst persecutions Mary was so ill that it was
said “she lay for weeks without speaking.” One
of the reasons why the English had feared to
have Philip marry their queen, was because he
was known to approve of torture, if by its means
the sufferers could be induced to give up beliefs
that he thought false. He now wrote to his sister,
“We have made a law, I and the most illustrious
queen, for the punishment of heretics and all
enemies of Holy Church; or rather, we have revived
the old ordinances of the realm, which will
serve this purpose very well.” It must not be
forgotten, however, that this burning at the stake
was done with the consent of Parliament, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
that, as Philip said, it was in accordance with the
old laws.</p>

<p>A hard life was Mary’s. She had no child, and
she was not sure of the faithfulness of her sister
and heir. It was chiefly by her determination to
marry Philip that she had lost the love of her
people, and after all that she had sacrificed for his
sake and all her affection for him, he cared nothing
whatever for her. An old ballad says that he
liked</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“The baker’s daughter in her russet gown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better than Queen Mary without her crown.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The crown of England was all that he cared for,
and about a year after their marriage, he left very
willingly for the continent. Mary controlled her
sorrow at the public farewell, but as soon as that
was over, she went to a window from which
she could see Philip’s barge, and there she sat
with her head resting on her hands and wept bitterly
till he was out of sight.</p>

<p>There was good reason why he should go, for
his father wished to give him the sovereignty of
the Low Countries; and there were some difficult
questions that arose and prevented his immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
return. As months passed, Mary became
more and more lonely. Her thoughts turned
toward Elizabeth. Another plot had been discovered.
Some of Elizabeth’s own attendants
were involved in it, and declarations were made
that it was not unknown to the princess herself.
Mary wrote her at <span class="locked">once:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I pray that it may not seem to you amiss that
it has been necessary to remove from your household
certain dangerous persons, not the least of
whose crimes it was that their confessions were
but an attempt to involve your Grace in their
evil designs. Rest assured that you are neither
scorned nor hated, but rather loved and valued
by me.” With the letter went the gift of a valuable
diamond.</p>

<p>After being away for nineteen months, Philip
returned to England. Mary was so happy that
she was ready to grant whatever he asked, though
it was so great a boon as the aid of England in
a war with France. Philip left in three or four
months to carry on the war, and never again did
his wife look upon the man whom she loved so
well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
The war went on, and Calais, which had long
been held by England, was taken by the French.
The English were wrathful. Five hundred years
earlier the kings of England had ruled wide-spreading
lands in France. One had lost, another
had won, but never before had England been left
without a foot of ground on the farther side of
the Channel. Mary was crushed. “When I
die,” she said, “look upon my heart, and there
you will see written the word ‘Calais.’”</p>

<p>The summer of 1558 had come. Mary’s
thoughts turned more and more toward her sister.
She left her palace and went to visit Elizabeth.
She arranged a visit from Elizabeth to herself
which was conducted with the greatest state.
The princess made the journey in the queen’s own
barge with its awning of green silk beautifully
embroidered. The queen’s ladies followed her in
six boats whose gorgeousness was almost dazzling,
for the ladies were dressed in scarlet damask,
in blue satin, and in cloth of silver, with
many feathers and jewels. In the royal garden
a pavilion had been built. It was in the shape of
a strong castle, only the material was not gray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
stone, but crimson velvet and cloth of gold. The
court feasted, the minstrels played, and the long,
bright day came to its close.</p>

<p>Mary had never been well, almost every autumn
she had suffered severely from sickness, and
now a fever seized upon her. There was little
hope of her recovery, but Philip sent her a ring
and a message instead of coming to her. Parliament
and the will of Henry VIII. had decided that
Elizabeth should follow Mary as queen, but
Philip begged Mary to name her sister as her
heir in order to make the succession especially
sure, and this was done. Mary grew weaker
every day, the end must be near. The courtiers
did not wait for it to come, crowds thronged the
house of Elizabeth, every one eager to be among
the first to pay his respects to her who would
soon become their sovereign, and to assure her
that, however others might have felt, he had
never been otherwise than faithful to her and her
alone.</p>

<p>Among these visitors was Count de Feria, one
of Philip’s train, who was in his master’s confidence.</p>

<p>“My lord sends your Grace assurances of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
most distinguished friendship,” said the count.
“He would have me say that his good will is as
strong and his interest in your Grace’s welfare as
sincere as it was when by his influence, so gladly
exerted, her Majesty was graciously pleased to release
your Grace from imprisonment. He would
also have me say that he has ever to the utmost
of his power urged upon her Majesty that she
should not fail to bequeath the crown to her only
sister and rightful heir, and he rejoices that his
words have had weight in her intentions.”</p>

<p>“Most gracious thanks do I return to the king
of Spain,” answered Elizabeth, “and fully do I
hold in my remembrance the favors shown to me
in the time of my captivity. For all his efforts
that I might be the heir of her Majesty, my sister,
I return due gratitude, though verily I have ever
thought myself entitled to the crown by the will
of my father, the decree of Parliament, and the
affection of the people.”</p>

<p>Three or four days later Mary sent Elizabeth
a casket containing jewels belonging to the
crown, and with it another casket of jewels belonging
to Philip which he had given orders to
have presented to her. Elizabeth well knew that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
the end of her sister’s life could not be long delayed,
and soon the word came that Mary was
dead.</p>

<p>“It may be a plot,” thought the wary princess,
“to induce me to claim the crown while the
queen lives, and so give my enemies a hold upon
me. Sir Nicholas,” she bade a faithful nobleman
who she well knew had ever been true to her
cause, “go you to the palace to one of the ladies
of the bedchamber, the one in whom I do put
most trust, and beg her that, if the queen is really
dead, she will send me the ring of black enamel
that her Majesty wore night and day, the one
that King Philip gave her on their marriage.”</p>

<p>Sir Nicholas set out on the short journey. The
rumor had, indeed, preceded the death of the
queen, but she died just as he reached the palace.
Before he returned, several of Queen Mary’s
councilors made a hurried journey to Elizabeth’s
house at Hatfield.</p>

<p>“Your Highness,” said they, “it is with the
deepest sadness that we perform our duty to announce
the death of her Majesty, Queen Mary.
To your Grace, as our rightful sovereign, do
we now proffer our homage, and promise to obey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
your Highness as the true and lawful ruler into
whose hands the government of the realm has
fallen.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth sank upon her knees and repeated
in Latin a sentence that was on the gold coins of
the country, “It is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvelous
in our eyes.”</p>

<p>Queen Mary died in the twilight of a November
morning, but her death was not known at once
in the city. Parliament was in session, and before
noon the lord chancellor called the two
houses together and <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“God this morning hath called to his mercy
our late sovereign lady, Queen Mary; which hap,
as it is most heavy and grievous to us, so have
we no less cause, otherwise, to rejoice with praise
to almighty God for leaving to us a true, lawful,
and right inheritrix to the crown of this realm,
which is the Lady Elizabeth, second daughter to
our late sovereign of noble memory, Henry
VIII.”</p>

<p>For an instant there was silence, then the house
rang with the cry, “God save Queen Elizabeth!
Long may Queen Elizabeth reign over us!” The
proclamation of her accession was now made in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
front of the palace of Westminster with many
soundings of trumpets, and later, in the city of
London.</p>

<p>“Did anyone ever see such a time?” said a
Londoner to his friend at night. “No one would
think that a queen had died since the day began;
there has been nothing but bonfires and bell-ringing
and feasting and shouting.”</p>

<p>“When people are glad, their joy will reveal
itself,” answered his friend.</p>

<p>“There might well be reason for me to rejoice,
but you are a Catholic, why should you
welcome the Lady Elizabeth?”</p>

<p>“Is she Catholic or Protestant?” asked the
other with a smile. “Who knows? There’s one
thing sure, she’ll have a merry court, trade will be
the gainer, and she’ll marry no foreign prince.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps having a new queen will also prevent
another season of the plague and give us greater
crops,” laughed the first; and then he added more
seriously, “Catholic or Protestant, I believe that
there be few in the land who will not rejoice to
see the death-fires no longer blaze at Smithfield.”</p>

<p>A week later the queen rode from Hatfield to
London. Hundreds of noble lords and ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
were in her retinue, and the number increased
with every mile. The road was lined with people
who shouted, “Queen Elizabeth! Queen Elizabeth!
Long may she reign! God save the
queen!” Children gazed at her eagerly, while
their mothers wept tears of joy, and young men
knelt and cried out their vows of loyalty and devotion.
Many of the bishops of the realm came
in procession to greet her and begged to kiss her
hand.</p>

<p>“Did you see that?” whispered a woman to
her neighbor. “The queen wouldn’t give her
hand to the cruel bishop of London. She knows
well it’s because of him that more than one good
man’s been burned at the stake. Oh, but she’ll
be a good queen, God bless her!”</p>

<p>The lord mayor and the aldermen came in their
scarlet robes to escort her to the palace, and a few
days later she went in state to the Tower of London.
The streets were strewn with fine gravel,
rich tapestries adorned the walls, banners waved,
trumpets sounded, boys from St. Paul’s school
made Latin speeches in her praise, and great companies
of children sang joyful songs of welcome.</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked very handsome as she rode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
into the city on horseback, wearing a habit of the
richest purple velvet. She replied to everyone’s
greeting, and made little Latin speeches in answer
to those of the schoolboys. At last she came
to the Tower, and this time she entered, not at the
Traitors’ Gate, but through the royal entrance,
and passed between long lines of soldiers, drawn
up, not to keep watch over a prisoner, but to do
honor to a queen.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="subhead">A SIXTEENTH CENTURY CORONATION</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">There</span> were several matters concerning
which the English people were eagerly
watching to see what the queen would
do, but whether her subjects expected to be
pleased or displeased with her deeds, they could
hardly help looking forward with interest to the
grand ceremonial of the coronation. Astrology
was in vogue, and every nobleman who wished
to be in fashion had his horoscope drawn up.
When a soldier was setting out for war or a captain
was embarking on some dangerous voyage,
he would go to a reader of the heavens to be told
on which day he must start in order to have his
expedition result prosperously. Queen Elizabeth
was a firm believer in the foretelling of destiny
by the stars, and she had especial confidence in
an astrologer called Dr. Dee. To him, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
she went that he might name a fortunate day for
the coronation. He named Sunday, January 15,
1559.</p>

<p>It was the custom for the sovereigns to ride
through the city of London in great state on their
way to Westminster, where they were crowned,
and Elizabeth’s ride was one of the most brilliant
ever known. There were trumpeters and
heralds in glittering armor; there were ladies on
horseback in habits of crimson velvet; there were
nobles in silks and satins and laces, gleaming with
gold and sparkling with jewels; there were long
lines of guards in the green and white of the
Tudors; and in the midst of all the splendor was
the queen in a gorgeous chariot lined with the
richest crimson velvet.</p>

<p>She bowed, she smiled, she waved her hand,
she leaned to one side of her carriage and then
to the other and listened intently to whatever any
one wished to say to her, and whether it was the
lord chancellor or the poorest woman in London,
each one was sure of a pleasant word and a gracious
smile from this new sovereign. Gifts were
showered upon her. The city of London gave her
a crimson satin purse filled with gold and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
large that she had to take both hands to lift it.
Elizabeth thanked the citizens and <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“To honor my passage through the town you
have been at great expense of treasure, so will I
spend not only treasure but the dearest drops of
my blood, if need be, for the happiness of my
people.”</p>

<p>“Your Grace,” said a poor woman in humble
garb, “I could bring you only this bit of rosemary,
but there’s many a blessing goes with it.”</p>

<p>“I thank you heartily,” responded the queen.
“It shall go with me to Westminster,” and it
did.</p>

<p>“I can remember fifty years ago when old
King Harry was crowned,” a white-haired man
called to her. The queen smiled upon him.
“May you live to remember me as long,” she responded.
Then she bade her chariot be stopped.
“I wish to hear what the child is saying,” she
said, for a pretty little boy was reciting some
verses in her praise. “Turn to one side so I
can see his face.”</p>

<p>Over several of the streets great arches had
been built with various exhibitions called pageants.
One represented a cave, and from it Time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
was leading forth his daughter Truth. The
young girl who took the part of Truth held in
her hand a most beautifully bound English Bible.</p>

<p>“Who is that with the scythe and hourglass?”
the queen asked.</p>

<p>“Time,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“It is time that has brought me here,” she
said as if to herself. The chariot moved slowly
on, and when it was almost under the arch,
“Truth” let down the volume by a silken cord.
Elizabeth took the Bible, kissed it and pressed
it to her heart, then held it up before the people.</p>

<p>“Truly, I thank my city of London,” said she.
“No other gift could have pleased me as this
does, and I promise you that every day I will
read it most diligently.”</p>

<p>So it was that Elizabeth made her journey
through London. The whole scene was rather
theatrical, but it pleased the people, and that was
what she most wished to do. All around her
were shouts of joy, silent tears of happiness, wild
promises of service, and sober, heartfelt prayers.
As she came to the gates of the city, she looked
back and called, “Farewell, my people, farewell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Be well assured that I will be a good queen to
you.” Then the cannon of the Tower thundered,
and Elizabeth went on to Westminster.</p>

<p>There she was crowned, and Sir Edward Dymock
performed the office of champion, introduced
by William the Conqueror. At the coronation
banquet he rode into the hall in full armor,
threw down his gauntlet and <span class="locked">proclaimed:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“If there be any manner of man that will say
and maintain that our sovereign lady, Queen
Elizabeth, is not the rightful and undoubted inheritrix
to the imperial crown of this realm of
England, I say he lieth like a false traitor, and
<i>that</i> I am ready to maintain with him, and therefore
I cast him my gage.” After a few minutes
a herald picked up the glove and presented it to
Sir Edward. This ceremony was repeated at
two other places in the hall. The queen then
drank to the health of the champion in a golden
cup which was presented to him as his reward.</p>

<p>During the glories of the coronation, the
people seemed to have almost forgotten for a
moment the important question whether the
queen would rule as a Catholic or a Protestant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
There had been much discussion about the matter,
and after the days of celebration there was even
more.</p>

<p>“She was brought up as a Protestant,” one
man said, “and she will rule as a Protestant.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but has she not declared that she is a
Catholic, and has she not been to mass with
Queen Mary? Does she not go to mass now?”
retorted another.</p>

<p>“Who wouldn’t go to mass to gain a kingdom?”
laughed a third lightly. “If Queen
Mary had named the queen of Scotland as her
heir&mdash;yes, I know there was a decree of Parliament,
but another decree might have been passed
as well as that&mdash;I don’t say the Catholics would
have tried to make the Scotch girl queen, but
Elizabeth was wise, she was wise.”</p>

<p>“It is two full months since Queen Mary
died,” said the second thoughtfully, “mass is said
in the churches every day. Her Majesty will
have no preaching without special permission,
but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No wonder,” broke in the third, “after the
sermon that the bishop of Winchester preached
at Queen Mary’s funeral. He praised Mary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
the skies, then said she had left a sister whom
they were bound to obey, for ‘a live dog is better
than a dead lion.’ A preacher will have to hide
his thoughts in something deeper than Latin to
keep them from the queen. I don’t wonder that
she looks after the sermons.”</p>

<p>“I know that she has been to mass many times
since Mary died,” admitted the first, “but don’t
you know what she did on Christmas morning?
She went to church with her ladies and she heard
the Gospel and the Epistle, but before the mass
she rose all of a sudden and left the chapel. No
true Catholic would stay away from mass on
Christmas day.”</p>

<p>“She might have been ill,” suggested the
second.</p>

<p>“As ill as she was when Queen Mary sent for
her to come and prove that she had nothing to do
with Wyatt’s rebellion,” said the third drily.
“Now, mark my words, Elizabeth, queen of
England, will never journey by a path because it
is straight; she’ll keep two roads open, and she’ll
walk in the one that has the best traveling.”</p>

<p>This uncertainty about Elizabeth’s religious
ideas was one reason why she was welcomed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
the throne so warmly. By birth and training she
was a Protestant, and therefore no Protestant
could consistently oppose her. In her later years
she had declared herself a Catholic, and the
Catholics had a reasonable hope that she would
show favor to them. Another good reason was
that there was neither Protestant nor Catholic
who could have been set up against her with
strong probability of success. Mary of Scotland
was the next heir, and she was a Catholic, but no
loyal Englishman, no matter what was his creed,
wished to see the queen of France raised to the
throne of England.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was twenty-five when she became
queen, and in her quiet years of study and observation
she had formed two very definite ideas
about ruling the kingdom. She meant to hold the
power in her own hands over church as well as
state, and she meant to use her mastery for the
gain of the people. Her father had claimed this
authority and had exercised it; while Edward
reigned, certain noblemen had ruled; while Mary
reigned, the church had ruled. Elizabeth wished
to be supported by nobles and church if possible,
but her chief dependence was upon the masses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
the people. When she made her first speech to
the judges of the realm, she said: “Have a care
over my people. They are <i>my</i> people. Every
man oppresseth and despoileth them without
mercy. They cannot revenge their quarrel nor
help themselves. See unto them, see unto them,
for they are my charge.” When Elizabeth was in
earnest and really meant what she said, she generally
used short, clear sentences whose meaning
could not be mistaken; but when she had something
to hide, she used long, intricate expressions,
so confused that they would sometimes bear two
opposite interpretations, and no one could declare
positively what she really meant to say.</p>

<p>This determination of hers to win the support
of the people was chiefly why she did not
hasten to make sudden changes in the church.
She did not at once object to saying mass, but she
ordered the Gospel and the Epistle to be read in
English as in the Protestant church. Then before
she went any further she waited to meet
her Parliament and see whether this change had
aroused opposition.</p>

<p>She had chosen for her chief adviser Sir William
Cecil, afterwards called Lord Burleigh. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
was a man of great ability and a Protestant, though
he had never shown any desire to become a martyr
for his faith. He held a high position during
Edward’s reign, but while Mary was in power,
although he went to mass as the law required,
he had little to say about church matters. He
lived quietly on his estate, interested in his fawns
and calves, writing letters about the care of his
fruit trees and about buying sheep; but during
these quiet years, he was reading and thinking
and planning, and gaining wisdom in all that
pertained to ruling a land. When Elizabeth made
him her secretary, she bade him always tell her
frankly what he believed was best, whether he
thought it would please her or not. He wished
to reestablish Protestantism, and before Elizabeth
had been on the throne five months, a decree was
passed that she and not the Pope was supreme
governor of the church in England. To dispute
this decree was declared to be treason, but
only clergymen and those who held office under
the crown were obliged to take the oath. A man
who refused was not beheaded as in Henry’s day,
but he was put out of his office, and according to
the ideas of the times, that was not a severe penalty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
for such an offence. The Catholic form of
worship was forbidden, and, while no one not in
office was obliged to tell his belief, all subjects
were commanded to attend the Protestant service
or pay a fine.</p>

<p>Elizabeth did not go as far as this without
watching closely for hints of what the majority
of her people were willing to permit. One hint
came to her the morning after her coronation.
She had freed a number of prisoners, as was
the custom at the crowning of a sovereign,
and after the act one of her courtiers knelt at her
feet with a roll of parchment in his hand and
<span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Your Majesty, will you graciously lend ear
to an earnest request from many of your
subjects?”</p>

<p>“To do for my beloved people that which is
for their good will ever be the ruling desire of
my heart,” replied the queen.</p>

<p>“Then do I humbly beg in the name of all
these good subjects and true”&mdash;and he unrolled
the parchment to show the long list of signatures&mdash;“I
beg that your Highness will release
unto us yet four more prisoners.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
“And who may these prisoners be that have
won so zealous an advocate?” asked the queen.</p>

<p>“Verily, your Grace, their names be Matthew,
Mark, Luke, and John. They have been shut up
in a language not understanded of the people, as
if they were in prison. Even to a prisoner speech
with his friends is not often forbidden. Will
your Majesty graciously command that the words
of the four Evangelists be put into English that
these captives may be released from their dungeon?”
This was really asking whether she
would rule as a Protestant, for the Catholics opposed
the circulation of the English Bible.</p>

<p>The queen showed no displeasure, but answered
with a <span class="locked">smile:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“It has sometimes come to pass that men have
learned to prefer their prison. Perchance it
would be better to inquire of these prisoners of
ours whether they wish to come out from behind
the bars.” When Parliament met, the question
was brought up, and a translation of the Bible
was ordered to be made at once. This was issued
as authorized by the queen.</p>

<p>There was another matter that perhaps weighed
more seriously upon the masses of the people than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
did the question which form of religion the queen
would favor, and that was her marriage. The
English longed to feel sure that the government
would go on peacefully even if their queen should
be taken from them. Before Henry’s father
came to the throne, there had been in England a
terrible time of civil war because there were different
claimants to the crown who were supported
by different parties, and most people in
the land would rather have a form of worship
with which they did not agree than feel that
the death of their sovereign would be followed
by a return of those bloody days. If Elizabeth
married and had a child to inherit the crown, the
land would settle down to quiet.</p>

<p>This was the way King Philip reasoned as well
as the English. Then he thought: “Elizabeth
is a wise, shrewd woman, and she can see that
with France and Scotland against her, her only
hope is to ally herself with Spain. The only
way to be sure of Spain’s support is to marry me
or some true friend of mine.” As for her Protestantism,
he did not think that matter of any
great importance, for he believed that she would
rather be sure of her throne than of her church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
When Elizabeth became queen, she had sent,
as was the custom, a letter to the various rulers
of Europe, formally announcing her accession.
Philip’s plans were made before the letter reached
him. He had concluded that his only safe course
was to marry her himself. He wrote to his ambassador,
Count de Feria, and explained why he
had come to such a conclusion. It was a great
sacrifice, he said, for it would not be easy to rule
England in addition to his other domains, and
Elizabeth must not be so unreasonable as to expect
him to spend much of his time with her.
She must give up her Protestant notions, of
course, become a Catholic, and agree to uphold
the Catholic faith in her country. To marry the
sister of his dead wife was against the law of the
church, but he was sure that he could induce the
Pope to grant special permission.</p>

<p>Philip’s reply to Elizabeth’s announcement was
an ardent letter begging her in most eloquent
terms to become his wife. The queen met his
request with the gravest courtesy, thanked him
for the honor that he had done her, and told him
how fully she realized of what advantage such
a splendid alliance would be to her. Philip wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
again and again; he told her how highly he
thought of her abilities and merits, and what a
charming, fascinating woman she was. Elizabeth
was shrewd enough to understand why this
keen politician was so eager for the marriage, but
she answered his letters with the utmost politeness,
and when other excuses failed, she told him
that she could not make any plans concerning
marriage without consulting Parliament, and
that body was not yet in session. She mischievously
allowed her ladies to see his glowing epistles,
but perhaps she may be pardoned for this offence,
inasmuch as Count de Feria had foolishly shown
the king’s letter, and Elizabeth knew precisely
what Philip had said about the great sacrifice he
was making in wedding her. Philip was so sure
she would marry him that he sent envoys to Rome
to get the Pope’s permission, but before they
could return, a final letter came from the queen,
refusing to take him for her husband. The Spaniard
was easily consoled, for within a month he
married the daughter of the French king.</p>

<p>How much attention the queen proposed to
pay to the advice of Parliament in this matter
was seen a little later when the House of Commons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
sent a delegation to her, begging that they
might have the great honor of an interview with
her Majesty. Elizabeth put on her royal robes
and went to the House in all state. An address
was made her. The speaker told her how they
gloried in her eminence and rejoiced in having
her for queen. Then he laid before her the affliction
it would be to the land if she should die
and leave no child to inherit not only her crown
but her goodness and her greatness. Finally he
begged in all humility that she would in her own
good time choose among her many suitors the
one most pleasing to herself.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was silent for a moment, and the
House feared that she might be offended, then
she smiled graciously and thanked them most
heartily for their love of her and for their care of
the kingdom. “I like your speech,” she said,
“because it does not attempt to bind my choice;
but it would have been a great presumption if
you had taken it upon yourselves to direct or limit
me whom you are bound to obey.” She told them
that whatever husband she chose should be of
such character that he would care for the kingdom
even as she herself did. Finally she said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
that if she did not marry, they ought not to feel
anxious about the realm, but to trust in God, for
in due time he would make it evident into whose
hands he wished the kingdom to fall. Then she
left the House, smiling so pleasantly and bowing
so graciously that few among them realized
at once that she had neither agreed with them nor
disagreed, and that she had promised them nothing
at all. She had merely declared that she intended
to have her own way and that they had
nothing to say about the matter.</p>

<p>King Philip was by no means the only man who
was eager for the hand of the English queen.
There was Philip’s friend, the Archduke Charles,
there were two French princes, the king of
Sweden, the king of Denmark, the king of Poland,
the Scotch Earl Arran, the English Earl of
Arundel, and still others as the months passed.
Several of these ardent wooers sent envoys to
England to plead their cause; the king of Sweden
sent his brother, and the king of Denmark
straightway despatched his nephew on the same
errand. These agents were received with the
highest honors, entertainments were arranged for
their pleasure, and every courtesy was shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
them. Elizabeth was graciousness itself to each,
and made each believe that she was especially inclined
to favor his master, but that for reasons of
state she could not give an answer at once. So
she kept them waiting for her royal decision, playing
one against another, and all this time England
was growing stronger.</p>

<p>Whether she was in earnest when she declared
that she did not wish to marry, no one knows, but
many think that her final refusal to one suitor
after another was because the only man for whom
she cared was Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester,
son of the Duke of Northumberland. He was a
man without special talent or ability, a handsome
courtier with graceful manners and much ambition.
He was married to Amy Robsart, a beautiful
girl and a great heiress, but while he was
at court, she was left in a lonely mansion in the
care of one of Leicester’s dependents, a man who
had the reputation of being ready to commit any
crime for which he was paid. Two years after
Elizabeth’s accession, Amy Robsart was found
dead at the foot of a staircase, and many believed
that she had been murdered. They would have
believed it still more firmly if they had known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
that a very short time later Leicester was trying
to persuade Philip that he would protect the
Catholics if he could be aided to marry the queen,
and to convince the French Protestants that he
would do the same for their church if he could
have their help in winning the hand of Elizabeth.
As for the queen herself, she would at one time
show the earl every sign of tenderness, and at
another she would declare, “I’ll marry no subject.
Marry a subject and make him king?
Never.”</p>

<span class="subhead">A QUEEN’S TROUBLES</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Never</span> had a queen a greater variety of
difficulties to meet. If she favored the
Catholics, the Protestants would not
support her; the Puritans were beginning to be of
some importance, and they were eager to have
every trace of Catholicism destroyed; but if she
introduced Protestant changes too rapidly, the
Catholics might revolt. She wished, it is probable,
to refuse her numerous suitors, but she
needed to keep on friendly terms with each as far
as possible. The royal treasury was low, and
among the nations of Europe there was not one
upon whose assistance England could count in
case of need.</p>

<p>Such were Elizabeth’s troubles at the beginning
of her reign, and as the months passed, the
difficulties became even more complicated. Scotland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
was ruled by Mary’s mother, who acted as
regent for her daughter. She was French and a
Catholic, and as more and more of the Scotch
became Protestants, they were determined to have
freedom for Protestant worship. Persecution
followed, imprisonment, torture, and burning at
the stake. Then came a fierce revolt. By the aid
of France this was suppressed, but the Protestants
appealed to Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“No war, my lords, no war,” declared she
to her council. “A queen does not lend aid to
rebels.”</p>

<p>“The rebels are in a fair way to become the
government,” suggested one councilor.</p>

<p>“England cannot afford war,” declared another.
“We have no money to spend on fleets
and armies.”</p>

<p>“The French are already in Scotland,” said
one. “More will follow, and their next step
will be across the border. If they are once in
England, we shall have to raise armies whether
we can or not.”</p>

<p>“True,” agreed another, “and surely it is
better to fight them in Scotland than on our own
soil.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
“If we attack the French, Philip will aid them
and try to put Mary on our throne.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” shouted three or four voices. “To
unite France, Scotland, and England under one
ruler would weaken his own power. He’ll not
do that.”</p>

<p>“This is a question of religion as well as
policy,” said another. “Shall not the government
of the church of England aid the Protestants
of Scotland?”</p>

<p>This last argument did not count for very
much with Elizabeth, but there was another one
that did. She left the council and thought over
the matter carefully and anxiously. “If I can
get power in Scotland,” she said to herself, “I
can induce the Scotch government to agree that
Mary shall never claim the title of queen of England.”
Money was borrowed from Antwerp, and
England began to prepare for fighting.</p>

<p>France became uneasy and sent word to <span class="locked">Elizabeth:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“We do protest and remonstrate against the
ruler of a neighboring kingdom giving aid to
rebels and revolters.” The French well knew
how sorely aggrieved the English felt at the loss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
of Calais, and as a bribe to the queen they offered
to give her back the town and citadel if she would
agree not to aid the Scotch Protestants.</p>

<p>Elizabeth knew then that the French feared her,
and she <span class="locked">replied:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“So long as the Queen of Scots doth falsely
claim to be also queen of this my realm, then so
long must I guard myself in the way that seems
to me wisest and best. To free my throne from
the attacks of false claimants and so secure peace
and safety for my people is worth far more to
me than any little fishing village in a foreign
country.”</p>

<p>The French were driven from Scotland, and a
treaty was made agreeing that Mary should give
up all claim to the throne of England. Mary had
empowered her agents to make whatever terms
they thought best, but when she saw this provision,
she refused to sign the treaty.</p>

<p>One year later a beautiful young woman stood
at the stern of a vessel, looking back with tearful
eyes at the shore from which she had sailed.
The twilight deepened, and night settled around
her. She turned away. “Adieu, my beloved
France,” she whispered, “farewell, farewell.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
Thus it was that a queen returned to her kingdom,
for the fair young woman was Mary, Queen
of Scots. Her husband had died, and there was
no longer any place in France for her. Scotland
asked her to return to the throne that had been
her own ever since she was a few days old. She
was only nineteen, and she was leaving the gay,
merry court in which nearly all her life had been
spent; she was leaving her friends and companions,
and for what? Scotland was the land of her
birth, but it was a foreign country to her. It was
not like her sunny France, it was a land of mist
and of cold, of plain habits and stern morals.
The queen was coming to her own, but her own
was strange to her.</p>

<p>Mary had asked Elizabeth’s permission to
shorten the voyage by passing through England.
“That must not be,” thought the English queen.
“Her presence here would be the signal for all
the discontented Catholics in the kingdom to follow
her banner.” Permission was refused, unless
Mary would agree beforehand to give up all claim
to the English crown.</p>

<p>“I ask but Elizabeth’s friendship,” said Mary.
“I do not trouble her state nor try to win over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
her subjects, though I do know there be some
in her realm that are not unready to hear offers”&mdash;but
she would not promise to give up her claim
to the crown. She was fully as independent as
Elizabeth, and she added regretfully, “I grieve
that I so far forgot myself as to ask a favor that
I needed not. Surely, I may go home into my
own realm without her passport or license. I
came hither safely, and I may have means to
return.”</p>

<p>Scotland rejoiced that the queen had come, and
welcomed her with bonfires and music and
speeches of welcome. The Scotch supposed that
they were pleasing her, but Mary wrote to her
<span class="locked">friends:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“In Edinburgh when I would have slept, five
or six hundred ragamuffins saluted me with
wretched fiddles and little rebecks, and then they
sang psalms loudly and discordantly; but one
must have patience.”</p>

<p>No one can help feeling sympathy with the
lonely girl of nineteen who had left all that she
loved to come and rule over a country that seemed
to her almost barbarous in contrast with her beloved
France. She was a Catholic; most of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
people were Protestants. She won many friends
and admirers, but she never gained the confidence
and steady affection of her people that made
Elizabeth strong. The queen and her subjects
grew further apart. Mary had been brought up
to believe that the marriage of Anne Boleyn was
not lawful, and that therefore she herself and not
Elizabeth was the rightful queen of England.
The French king had taught her to sign herself
“Queen of Scotland and England.” Now that
she had returned to Scotland, she dropped the
latter part of the title, but demanded that Elizabeth
should declare her heir to the throne, as
she certainly was by all laws of the hereditary
descent of the crown. Elizabeth firmly refused.</p>

<p>It was probable that Mary would marry, and it
was a matter of importance to Elizabeth that the
husband should not be one who could strengthen
the Scotch claim to the throne. Mary consulted
Elizabeth about one or two of her suitors, and
suddenly the English queen surprised all Europe
by offering to Mary the unwilling hand of her
own favorite, the Earl of Leicester, and hinted,
though in her usual equivocal fashion, that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
Mary would marry the earl, she would be recognized
as the next heir to the crown. “I would
marry Robin myself,” declared the queen to
Mary’s commissioner, Sir James Melville, “save
that I am determined to wed no man.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth talked with Sir James most familiarly,
and this woman who was so shrewdly guiding
her millions of Englishmen and guarding her
throne from Mary of Scotland, often seemed to
think of nothing but whether she or her rival had
the prettier face.</p>

<p>“Which is the fairer?” she demanded, “I or
the queen of Scotland?”</p>

<p>“Your Majesty is the fairest queen in England,
and ours is the fairest queen in Scotland,”
replied Sir James wisely.</p>

<p>“That is not an answer,” declared Elizabeth.
“Which of us two is the fairer?”</p>

<p>“Your Majesty is whiter, but our queen is
very winsome.”</p>

<p>“Which is of greater stature?”</p>

<p>“Our queen,” replied Sir James.</p>

<p>“Your queen is over high then,” said Elizabeth,
“for I am neither too high nor too low.
But tell me, how does she amuse herself?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
“She hunts and reads and sometimes she plays
on the lute and the virginals.”</p>

<p>“Does she play well?”</p>

<p>“Reasonably well for a queen,” declared Sir
James audaciously.</p>

<p>“I wish I could see her,” said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“If your Grace should command me, I could
convey you to Scotland in the dress of a page,
and none be the wiser,” suggested Sir James
gravely, and Elizabeth did not seem at all displeased
with the familiarity.</p>

<p>When the commissioner was again in Scotland,
Mary asked what he thought of Elizabeth. “She
has neither plain dealing nor upright meaning,”
said he, “and she is much afraid that your Highness’s
princely qualities will drive her from her
kingdom.”</p>

<p>Leicester was refused. Mary was now twenty-three,
but she chose for her husband Lord Darnley,
a handsome, spoiled child of nineteen. He
was a Catholic and after herself the next heir to
the English throne. Elizabeth was angry, but
she was helpless.</p>

<p>A year later Sir James made a journey from
Scotland to London in four days, as rapid traveling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
as was possible at that time. He called upon
Lord Burleigh and gave him an important message.
It was evening, and the queen was dancing
merrily with her ladies and nobles when Cecil
whispered a word in her ear. No more mirth did
she show. She sat down, resting her head on her
hand. The ladies pressed around her. Suddenly
she burst out, “The Queen of Scots has a fair
young son, and I am but a barren stock.”</p>

<p>When Elizabeth found that it was impossible
to have her own way, she usually accepted the
situation gracefully. Sir James came to see her
in the morning. She met him with a “volt,” a
bit of an old Italian dance, and declared the news
was so welcome that it had cured her of a fifteen-days’
illness. She agreed to be godmother to
Mary’s son, and as a christening gift she sent a
font of pure gold.</p>

<p>The next news from Scotland was that Lord
Darnley had been murdered, and that there was
reason for believing the Earl of Bothwell, a bold,
reckless adventurer, to have been the murderer.
Mary had soon tired of the silly, arbitrary boy
and had kept her dislike no secret. Two months
later she married Bothwell, and there were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
many reasons for thinking that she had helped
to plan the murder that the Scotch nobles took up
arms against her, and imprisoned her in Lochleven
Castle, until she could be tried. She was
forced to sign a paper giving up all claim to the
Scotch throne, and her baby son James, only one
year old, was crowned king of Scotland.</p>

<p>Elizabeth raged that mere subjects should venture
to accuse a queen as if she were an ordinary
person. “How dare they call their sovereign to
account?” demanded the angry ruler of England.
She declared that Mary’s throne should be restored
to her and that the rebels should be punished.
Indeed, in her wrath she made all sorts
of wild vows and threats which she had no power
to keep.</p>

<p>This support, however, encouraged Mary’s
friends to attempt her rescue. She escaped from
Lochleven; her followers fought an unsuccessful
battle; she rode on horseback, sixty miles in a
single day; she was taken in a fishing boat to the
English side of Solway Frith; and then the deposed
queen was safe in England, in the realm of
the sovereign from whom she believed she might
expect assistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
Elizabeth and her council considered the matter
long and earnestly.</p>

<p>“Let us return her to Scotland.”</p>

<p>“Then she will be put to death, and the Catholics
of Scotland and England will be aroused
against Queen Elizabeth.”</p>

<p>“Shall we place her back upon the Scotch
throne?”</p>

<p>“We could not without war with Scotland and
probably with France.”</p>

<p>“Shall we invite her to remain in England
as the guest of the queen?”</p>

<p>“And offer her as a head for every conspiracy
that may be formed against her Majesty? No.”</p>

<p>“There is something else. We have a right to
know whether we are protecting an innocent
young woman who had fled to us for help, or a
criminal who has aided in the murder of her
husband.”</p>

<p>So the question was discussed, and it was
finally decided that Mary should be kept as a
prisoner and tried before special commissioners
appointed for the purpose. At the end of this investigation
Elizabeth declared that she had been
proved neither innocent nor guilty. That question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
was dropped, but in spite of her angry protest
and her demands to be set free, the queen of
Scotland was kept in England for eighteen years,
treated in many respects with the deference due
to a sovereign, but guarded as closely as any
prisoner.</p>

<p>In the midst of these complications that required
the keenest acumen of the most vigorous
intellect, Elizabeth did not lay aside her whims
and vanities. One of her favorite customs was
that of wearing an “impress,” a device somewhat
like a coat of arms, which was changed as often
as the wearer chose. Each “impress” had a
motto, and the queen used a different one
almost every day. One of her mottoes was, “I
see and am silent;” another was, “Always the
same.”</p>

<p>At one time she devoted herself to the works
of the early Christian writers, but she found
leisure to complain of the poor portraits that
people were making of her. They were not
nearly so handsome as she thought they ought
to be, and she actually had a proclamation drawn
up forbidding all persons to attempt her picture
until “some special cunning painter” should produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
a satisfactory likeness. Her “loving subjects”
were then to be permitted to “follow the
said pattern.”</p>

<p>For even the most “cunning artist” to satisfy
both her Majesty and himself must have been a
difficult matter, for she positively forbade having
any shade given to her features. “By nature
there is no shade in a face,” said the queen, “it
is only an accident.”</p>

<p>Another of her foibles was that of wearing
the dress of different countries on different days,
one day Italian, the next day French, and so on.
It seems not to have been easy to have these
gowns made in England, and Elizabeth sent to
the continent for a dressmaker. The secretary
of state had been the one ordered to draw up the
proclamation restraining all save the “cunning
artist” yet to be discovered from making her
picture, and now we find him ordering the English
ambassador to France to “cause” his wife to
find the queen “a tailor that hath skill to make
her apparel both after the French and the Italian
manner.” This command was given only a few
days after the murder of Lord Darnley which
aroused all England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
Elizabeth always enjoyed going about among
her subjects, and one of her early visits was to
the University of Cambridge. She entered the
town on horseback in a habit of black velvet. Her
hat was heaped up with feathers, and under it
she wore a sort of net, or head-dress, that was
all ablaze with precious stones. The beadles of
the university gave her their staffs, signifying
that all power was in her hands. She could not
hold them all, and she gave them back, saying
jestingly, “See that you minister justice uprightly,
or I will take them into mine hands
again.” According to ancient custom at a royal
visit, she was presented with two pairs of gloves,
two sugarloaves, and some confectionery. Long
orations were made to her. She was praised as
showing forth all the virtues, and although she
sometimes interrupted the orators by saying,
“That is not true,” she commended them at the
end so warmly that they had no fear of having
offended her.</p>

<p>She did not hesitate to break in upon any
speaker, and the next day, when the minister was
preaching, she sent a noble lord to tell him to
put his cap on. Another high official was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
despatched to him before he left the pulpit to
inform him that the queen liked his sermon. This
was on Sunday morning. That evening the
chapel was made into a theatre, and an old Latin
play was acted for her amusement.</p>

<p>Elizabeth went from college to college, and at
each she listened to an oration in her praise and
received the usual gift of gloves, sugarloaves,
and confectionery. Cambridge had long expected
the honor of this visit, and the members of the
various learned societies had made preparations
for it by composing poems of welcome and praise
in Greek, Hebrew, and several other languages.
Copies of these verses had been richly bound, and
the volume was presented to her as a memorial of
her welcome.</p>

<p>All the sermons and speeches and plays were
in Latin, and near the close of the queen’s stay,
a humble petition was made to her that she would
speak to her hosts in that language.</p>

<p>“I am but a poor scholar,” said she, “but if
I might speak my mind in English, I would not
stick at the matter.”</p>

<p>Then answered the chancellor of the <span class="locked">university:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
“Your Highness, in the university nothing
English may be said in public.”</p>

<p>“Then speak you for me,” bade the queen.
“The chancellor is the queen’s mouth.”</p>

<p>“True, your Majesty,” he responded, “but I
am merely the chancellor of the university; I
have not the honor to be the chancellor of your
Grace.”</p>

<p>After a little more urging, the queen delivered
an excellent Latin speech, which she had evidently
composed beforehand, and gave the authorities
to understand that she should make the university
a generous gift either during her life
or at her death. This manner of arousing the
expectations of her subjects was one of her ways
of securing their faithfulness. She used to keep
long lists of men of ability and worth, and a man,
knowing that his name was on that list, would
not fail to be true to her, expecting every day a
pension or some other reward of his devotion.</p>

<p>Robert Dudley was high steward of Cambridge,
and Elizabeth seems to have exhausted
her generous intentions toward the university by
presenting him with Kenilworth Castle and manor
and other lands. Then it was that she made him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
Lord Leicester, and when in the ceremony he
was kneeling gravely before her with bowed head,
this queen of magnificence and barbarism, of
subtlety of intellect and coarseness of manner,
thought it a brilliant jest to stretch out the royal
forefinger to tickle the back of his neck and
arouse him from his unwonted seriousness.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="subhead">ELIZABETH AND PHILIP</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">However</span> fond Elizabeth was of Leicester,
she would never allow him to presume
upon her favor. A friend of his
one day demanded to see the queen, and the
usher, or “gentleman of the black rod,” as he
was called, refused to permit him to enter. Leicester
threatened the usher with the loss of his
position, but that gentleman went straightway to
the queen, fell at her feet, and told the whole
story.</p>

<p>“Your Grace,” said he, “I have but obeyed
your commands, and all that I crave is to know
the pleasure of your Majesty. Shall I obey yourself
or my Lord Leicester?”</p>

<p>Leicester had also attempted to tell his side of
the story, but a wave of the queen’s hand had
silenced him. Now she turned upon him haughtily
and <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
“I have wished you well, my lord, but know
you that my favor is not so locked up in you that
others can have no share. I will have here but
one mistress and no master.”</p>

<p>Leicester tried to take revenge on the queen’s
vanity by asking her for an appointment in
France.</p>

<p>“Do you really wish to go?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“It is one of the things that I most desire,”
answered the earl. Elizabeth pondered a moment,
she glanced at Leicester, and then turned
to the Spanish ambassador, who stood near, and
said <span class="locked">laughingly:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I can’t live without seeing him. Why, he
is my lap-dog, and wherever I go, people expect
that he will follow.” Leicester did not go to
France.</p>

<p>Elizabeth’s old suitor, King Philip, was giving
her more trouble than Leicester. The Low Countries,
as Holland and Belgium were then called,
formed part of his domain. Most of the inhabitants
of these lands were Protestants, and they
were making a determined resistance to the rule
of the Spanish king. Elizabeth believed that if
Philip was successful he might attack England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
The course decided upon by the English council
was to send money secretly to the revolters in
the Low Countries. This would not make open
war with Spain, but would enable the king’s
opponents to oppose him more strongly, and would
keep him too busy to think of invading England.</p>

<p>Even before Elizabeth came to the throne, the
English Channel and the neighboring seas were
swarming with bold sailors who attacked any
vessel that they believed might be carrying gold
or any other cargo of value. To-day this would
be called piracy, it was then looked upon as brave
seamanship. These pirates cared little for the
nationality of a vessel, but Spain had more ships
at sea than any other country, and these ships were
loaded with gold from America or with valuable
goods from India, therefore, Spain was the greatest
sufferer; and as the English sailors were generally
more bold and more successful than others
in making these attacks, the wrath of Spain toward
England grew more and more bitter. Whenever
a Spanish ship captured an English ship, the
sailors were hanged, or imprisoned, or perhaps
tortured, or even burned at the stake as heretics.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
“It is only fair,” said Elizabeth, “to get our
reprisal in whatever way we can;” and whoever
had taken a Spanish vessel, be he English or belonging
to some other nation, was allowed to
bring his prize into an English port and there
dispose of it.</p>

<p>The slave-trade, too, was looked upon as an
honorable business and a valuable source of wealth
for England. Spain forbade all nations to trade
with her American colonies, but these bold Englishmen
kidnapped negroes on the African coast,
carried them to America, and found ready purchasers
in the Spanish colonists of the West
Indies. One of these English fleets was attacked
by the Spanish in the Gulf of Mexico, and three of
the vessels were captured. Elizabeth raged and
declared that she would have vengeance. It is
possible that her indignation was no less from
the fact that two of the vessels of this fleet belonged
to the queen herself.</p>

<p>It was not long before the opportunity for revenge
appeared. Four Spanish vessels loaded
with money for the payment of Philip’s army were
chased by French pirates and took refuge in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
English harbor. Under the pretence of securing
the safety of this money, it was quietly transferred
to the royal treasury.</p>

<p>The Spanish ambassador protested, but there
was much delay before he was permitted to see
the queen. He presented a letter from Duke Alva,
who commanded the Spanish forces in the Low
Countries, claiming the treasure.</p>

<p>“I am not wholly without reason,” declared
Elizabeth coolly, “for believing that this gold
does not belong to the king of Spain.”</p>

<p>“This is the duke’s own writing, your Highness,”
said the ambassador.</p>

<p>“Not willingly or with intent to deal unjustly
would I seize upon aught that with propriety belongs
to his Majesty,” said the queen, “but certain
rumors have reached me that divers persons
of Genoa are sending this money to the Low
Countries to make profit by loaning it to the
duke.”</p>

<p>“Your Majesty, I give you most solemn assurance
that such is not the case,” declared the helpless
ambassador.</p>

<p>“A few days will determine whether your informants
or mine be correct,” said the queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
haughtily. “If the king of Spain can prove that
the gold is his, I will restore it to him. Otherwise,
I will pay the usual rate of interest to its true
owners, and keep it for good service in my own
kingdom.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth was right in her belief that Philip
would not wish to have another war on his hands,
and so would made no attack upon her kingdom.
He seized Englishmen and English property in
Antwerp, but this was small loss to England, for
Elizabeth retaliated by imprisoning the Spaniards
who were doing business in her kingdom and
whose possessions were of far more value than
those of the English in Antwerp.</p>

<p>Duke Alva was annoyed and delayed in his
plans by the loss of the money, but the fighting
went on most bitterly. In France there was a
kind of peace between the court and the Huguenots,
as the French Protestants were called, but on
neither side was there forgiveness or forgetfulness.
The leader of the Huguenots was wounded
in Paris by an assassin. Catherine de Medicis,
mother of the French king, alarmed her son by declaring
that the Huguenots would take a fearful
vengeance for this attack, and induced him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
consent to a terrible slaughter in which thousands
of Protestants were slain. This was the massacre
of St. Bartholomew’s Day.</p>

<p>The English were then thoroughly aroused.
Thousands were ready to take up arms and avenge
the wicked murders. To the French ambassador
fell the unwelcome task of telling the dreadful
story to the queen of England. He asked for an
audience, but she refused it. For three days she
hesitated; at length he was admitted. The queen
and all her attendants were dressed in the deepest
mourning. The unhappy ambassador entered the
room and advanced through the lines of lords and
ladies. Little return was made to his respectful
salutations, there was dead silence. Finally the
queen with grave, stern face, came a few steps
toward him, greeted him with politeness, and
motioned him to follow her to one side.</p>

<p>“I have no wish to show discourtesy to your
sovereign,” she said, “but it was impossible that
I should bring my mind sooner to speak of a
matter so grievous to me and to my realm.” The
ambassador bowed silently, and the queen went
on. “Can it be that this strange news of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
prince whom I have so loved and honored has
been correctly reported to me?”</p>

<p>“In truth,” answered the ambassador gravely,
“it is for this very thing that I am come to lament
with your Majesty over the sad accident.”</p>

<p>“An accident?” questioned Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Surely, your Majesty, for is not that an accident
which is forced upon a sovereign by no will
of his own, but by the plots and treasons of those
whom he would gladly have befriended?”</p>

<p>“How may that be?” asked Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“The evening before the sad event the king
was horrified to learn that in revenge for the
attempt at assassination, a terrible deed had been
planned. It was no less than the imprisonment
of himself and his family and the murder of the
Catholic leaders.”</p>

<p>“How was this known?”</p>

<p>“One whose conscience could no longer bear
the burden revealed the wicked plot. The words
and looks of several of the conspirators gave
gloomy confirmation to the story.”</p>

<p>“Why not imprison the traitors? Is there no
dungeon in France and no executioner?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
“Your Majesty, not all rulers have your keen
judgment and your control of even the strongest
sentiments of your heart. The king has not yet
learned to govern his feelings by moderation. He
had but a few short hours to decide what was
best. Many were urging him on to inflict the
most severe penalties, and at last he yielded, and
allowed that to be done which he will ever regret.
Especially does he lament that with a
populace so wildly excited and so indignant at the
plot against the king, it is all but impossible that
some who are innocent should not have perished
with the guilty. This is his chief cause of grief.”
The ambassador had made as smooth a story as
possible, but how would the queen receive it?</p>

<p>She was silent for several minutes, then she
<span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Although I could not accept his Majesty, the
king of France, for a husband, yet shall I always
revere him as if I were his wife, and ever feel
jealous for his honor. I will believe that from
some strange accident, which time will perhaps
more fully explain, these murders have come to
pass. I recommend the Protestants among his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
people as especially entitled to his Highness’s
loving care and protection.”</p>

<p>When this speech was reported to Catherine de
Medicis, she smiled grimly and said, “The queen
of England can hardly ask greater protection than
she herself grants; namely, to force no man’s
conscience, but to permit no other worship in the
land than that which the ruler himself practises.”</p>

<p>Four years had passed since Mary of Scotland
fled to England. Nothing had been satisfactorily
determined in regard to her guilt or innocence.
An important part of the testimony against her
was a casket of her letters to Bothwell. Elizabeth’s
commissioners believed these letters to
be the work of Mary’s hand, but the English
queen refused to permit them to be made public.
Whether they were true or were forgeries, she
would not allow a queen, a member of her own
family, to be declared guilty of murder.</p>

<p>Mary was put under the care of the Earl of
Shrewsbury. The sovereign claimed the right
to give prisoners of state or guests of the nation
to her nobles for watch or entertainment or both.
“I am about to trust you as I would trust few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
men,” the queen said to the earl when she informed
him of his new task. He was obliged
to accept the charge meekly, but it must have
been a heavy burden. If his family moved from
one of his manors to another, Mary must go
with them. She must have the attendance and
treatment due to her rank, but she must be closely
watched to prevent, if possible, the sending of
letters and messages to any that might conspire
to rescue her. Guests of the family must be kept
from meeting her. It is no wonder that the
earl’s health gave out. He went away for medical
treatment, and at once there came a letter from
<span class="locked">Cecil:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The queen has heard that you are gone from
home. She says she can scarce believe it, but she
bids me know from you what order you left for
attendance upon the Queen of Scots. She would
not that you should be long away from her, for
she feels it only in accordance with her honor
that the said queen be honorably attended, and
for this she cares as much as for any question of
surety.”</p>

<p>The earl did not recover at once, and the queen
sent another trusty servant to take charge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
Mary. The caring for the prisoner and her
retinue was no small matter, for there were so
many in her train that her unwilling host felt
greatly relieved when Elizabeth commanded that
their number be reduced to thirty.</p>

<p>Soon after Mary’s coming to England there
was an uprising in the north among the nobles
who wished to oblige Elizabeth to acknowledge
Mary as her heir. They planned for the Scotch
queen to marry an English duke of great power
and wealth. This conspiracy was discovered,
Mary was kept for a while in closer confinement,
and after some time the duke was beheaded.
Elizabeth long refused to sign the warrant, and
she would pay no attention whatever to the counsels
of the royal advisers in regard to the execution
of Mary, though one called her “that dangerous
woman,” another, “a desperate person.”
The archbishop of York advised Elizabeth to “cut
off the Scottish queen’s head forthwith;” Cecil
was decidedly in favor of this plan, for he believed
that it was the only way to secure peace to the
kingdom, that so long as Mary lived there would
be plots, and that, however closely she was
watched, she would find means to communicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
with plotters. The rebellion in the north was
the only revolt of any importance while Elizabeth
was on the throne. It was punished most severely
by a vast number of executions.</p>

<p>Not long after the revolt, the Pope excommunicated
Elizabeth. He pronounced upon her
a solemn curse whether she ate or drank, went in
or went out; whatever she did, she was accursed,
and her subjects were no longer called upon to
obey her. Neither Philip nor the king of France
ventured to have this decree published in his
kingdom, and in England it seems to have produced
no effect whatever. The government was
every day becoming stronger. The man who
disobeyed did not often escape punishment, and
Englishmen in general preferred to be excommunicated
by the Pope in Italy than to be executed
by Elizabeth in England.</p>

<p>The queen gained steadily in power and in the
affections of her subjects. Some of this increase
of power was because by good management England
had grown richer, some of it because by her
shrewd treatment of France and Spain she had
won the deference of both. Her means of gaining
power were not always to be commended;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
she was not above maintaining nominally peaceful
relations with a king while she was aiding
his revolting subjects; and she would favor first
one proposed marriage and then another, as it
might suit her purposes to win the good will of
the country to which the respective wooers belonged.
When she was once accused of deriding
and mocking whoever sought her hand, she replied
with an air of injured innocence that she
never “mocked or trifled” with any of those who
would have had her in marriage, that she had
given them her answer as promptly as the “troubles
and hindrances that were happening in the
world” would permit. Dishonorable as her behavior
sometimes was, it is only fair to Elizabeth
to remember that in her times fair dealing among
nations was the exception rather than the rule;
the country that could gain the advantage over
another country was looked upon as having shown
the greater ability.</p>

<p>Part of Elizabeth’s gain in power was due to
the improved condition of England. The country
was at peace, taxes were not large; ways of living
were becoming more comfortable; all subjects
were required to attend the Protestant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
church, but fines and loss of office were small
matters when compared with the axe and the
stake; bold sailors were taking English ships to
distant harbors; a great exchange had been built
in London where merchants from any part of the
world might come to buy and sell; and the thing
that made all these advantages possible was the
fact that the government was firm and sure.
That the queen was the vainest woman who ever
lived, that she would say one thing one day and
quite another thing the next morning was perhaps
not known outside of her court, and in any
case, her subjects would have forgiven her faults,
for they felt that she was ever a friend to them,
that she believed in them and trusted them. At
one time a gun went off by accident and the bullet
came very near the queen. Elizabeth straightway
issued a proclamation, “I will believe nothing
against my subjects,” said she, “that loving parents
would not believe of their children.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth refused positively to stand at the
head of any one party; she was determined to be,
as she said, “a good queen” to all her subjects.
It must be admitted that she was sometimes unjust
to the “great folk,” but nothing else aroused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
her wrath so surely and so dangerously as a
wrong done to her people, to the masses of her
subjects, with whom she felt sympathy and to
whom she turned for support. It was an ancient
custom in the land that whenever the sovereign
went from one part of the kingdom to another,
the people of whatever district he might chance
to be in should furnish him with food for his attendants,
often numbered by hundreds. “Purveyors,”
or officers whose business it was to attend
to the providing of food, went ahead of the
royal party and took what they chose to declare
would be needed. Sometimes they paid for it&mdash;whatever
price they chose&mdash;sometimes they did
not, but in any case the purveyor was sorely
tempted to seize larger quantities of supplies than
would be needed and sell them elsewhere. When
Elizabeth discovered that one of her officers had
been behaving in this manner, she was most indignant.
“My people shall suffer by no such
abuses,” she declared. One article that the
cheating purveyor had seized and sold for the
advantage of his own pocket was a quantity of
smelts. “Take him to the pillory,” bade the
angry queen. “Hang the smelts about his neck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
and see you to it that there shall he sit for three
full days. Let him who steals from my people
keep in his account that he has to reckon not
with them but with me; they are <i>my</i> people, and
I am their queen.”</p>

<p>This proud sovereign who ruled her haughty
nobles with so high a hand enjoyed showing to
her subjects how humble she could be. When
she was tormenting the king of Spain by every
means in her power, she kept on one Maundy
Thursday the old custom of feet-washing. Elizabeth
was thirty-nine years of age, and therefore
the poor women who were seated before her for
the ceremony were thirty-nine in number. The
queen’s ladies brought silver basins filled with
warm water delicately perfumed with flowers and
sweet-smelling herbs. Cushions were placed, and
on these the queen kneeled as she washed one
foot of each of the poor women, marked it with
a cross and kissed it. It takes a little from
the humility of the act to read that just before
the queen’s performance of this duty the feet of
the thirty-nine poor women were most carefully
scrubbed and perfumed by three separate officials.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
There must have been some competition to be
among the chosen thirty-nine, if any one guessed
what would happen, for before the queen bade
them farewell, she presented each one with a pair
of shoes, cloth for a gown, the towel and apron
used in the ceremony, a purse of white leather
containing thirty-nine pence, and a red purse
containing twenty shillings. Besides these gifts,
each one received bread, fish, and wine.</p>

<p>It is no wonder that Elizabeth was popular
among her subjects, and that she rejoiced in their
good will, but some of the consequences of their
devotion were not agreeable. It was the custom
to wear ornaments called aglets, which were
somewhat like large loops. These were made of
gold and often set with precious stones. They
were sewed upon various parts of her robes of
state, and they had a fashion of disappearing
when the queen was dining in public, for her subjects
who were near enough to secure one as a
souvenir of their beloved queen seem to have
taken advantage of their opportunity. The persons
who had charge of her wardrobe made in
their books many such entries as <span class="locked">these:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
“Lost from her Majesty’s back the 17th of
January, at Westminster, one aglet of gold, enamelled
blue, set upon a gown of purple velvet.”</p>

<p>Another one <span class="locked">is:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“One pearl and a tassel of gold being lost from
her Majesty’s back, off the French gown of black
satin, the 15th day of July, at Greenwich.”</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="subhead">ENTERTAINING A QUEEN</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Many</span> a monarch has liked to wander
about his domains in disguise and
hear what his subjects had to say
about him when they did not suspect that he was
near. Elizabeth thoroughly enjoyed journeying
about her kingdom, but she did not wish to be disguised,
she preferred that everyone should know
where she was and should be able to sing her
praises in such wise that she need not lose the
pleasure of hearing them. These journeys of hers
were called progresses, and while on a progress
she was always entertained by some wealthy subject.</p>

<p>Whenever there was a rumor that the queen
meant to leave town, every nobleman who owned
a beautiful country seat would tremble, for while
a royal visit was an honor, it was also a vast expense
and responsibility. The queen would set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
out with a great retinue, but for what place no
one was told until a few days before the journey
began. If there was the least reason to think
that she would go to a certain district, the noblemen
of that district hastened to engage provisions
of all sorts. The luckless favorite was at last
told that the great honor of entertaining his
sovereign was to be bestowed upon him. He had
to appear exceedingly grateful and to make
humble speeches of thankfulness, even though he
was wondering between the words where he could
buy meat and fish and fruit and other food for a
great company.</p>

<p>As soon as the queen’s messengers were out of
sight, then was there a hurrying and a scurrying.
In one case many of the nobles in a certain district
were so afraid of being victims that they
engaged all the provisions in the vicinity, and the
unfortunate man who was first chosen had to send
post-haste to Flanders to buy food for his unwelcome
guests. One man provided for a royal
visit of three days wheat, rye, oats, butter, partridges,
trout, lobsters, beer, ale, wine, sugarloaves,
turkeys, pheasants, salmon, deer, sheep,
oysters, plums, preserved lemons, sweetmeats,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
cinnamon water, beef, ling, sturgeons, pigeons,
etc. These eatables had to be obtained in large
quantities; for instance, this three-days’ host
bought fifty-two dozen chickens for one item, and
twenty bushels of salt for another.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. Damask, knives, and pewter
dishes must be hired; carpenters and bricklayers
must be engaged to make all sorts of changes in
the house and grounds that might suit the whim
of a queen who did not hesitate to express her
opinions if she was displeased. Moreover, when
this queen was entertained, she expected to find
entertainment; dancers must be hired, and perhaps
a whole company of actors must be engaged
to present a play for her pleasure.</p>

<p>It is not at all wonderful that even the richest
of Elizabeth’s subjects dreaded a visit from their
queen. The archbishop of Canterbury wrote a
most pitiful letter about the difficulty of finding
bedrooms for so great a party. He explained
what he had planned, and ended, “Here is as
much as I am able to do in this house.” One
man who had been notified that the queen would
soon honor his castle wrote to Cecil, “I trust you
will provide that her Majesty’s stay be not above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
two nights and a day,” and he added anxiously,
“I pray God that the room and lodgings may be
to her content.”</p>

<p>This man, like the rest of Elizabeth’s hosts,
was not anxious without good reason, for the
queen often manifested but slight gratitude for
the efforts of her entertainers, while she seldom
hesitated to express her disapproval if anything
occurred that did not please her. At one house
she discovered by chance an image of the Virgin
Mary, and within a fortnight her host was in
prison on the charge of being a Catholic. To
another house she made an unexpected visit when
the owner was away from home. The unfortunate
lord had a fine deer park in which he took
great pride, but on his return he found that large
numbers of the deer had been slaughtered to
amuse the queen and her retinue. He was so
indignant that he “disparked” the ground. It
seems that it was not safe for a man to do what
he would with his own, for not many weeks later
a friend of his at court wrote to <span class="locked">him:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Her Majesty has been informed that you
were not pleased at the good sport she had in
your park. Have a wary watch over your words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
and deeds. It was Leicester who brought her to
your castle. He has taken no small liking to it,
and it might easily be that he would claim to have
good title to the same.”</p>

<p>The most brilliant of Elizabeth’s entertainments
was given her by Robert Dudley at Kenilworth
Castle not long after he became Lord
Leicester. For nineteen days he was her host,
but he could well afford to make the outlay, for
the queen’s recent gifts to him were valued at
£50,000, an amount that was worth as much then
as a million and a quarter dollars to-day.</p>

<p>On this visit Elizabeth was received at a neighboring
town and was feasted in a great tent.
Then after a day’s hunting she and her train arrived
at the fine old castle with its manor lands
of hill and dale, forest and pasture. It was already
eight in the evening, but there were all
sorts of sights for her to see before she entered
the castle. First came forth ten sibyls in white
silk, gleaming in the soft twilight. One of them
made a speech of welcome, and the company
passed into the tilt-yard. There stood a tall
porter, big of limb and stern of countenance. He
brandished a heavy club as he strutted to and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
fro, apparently talking to himself. He did not
know, he declared, what all this chattering, riding,
and trudging up and down was for, but he did not
like it, and there was no one great enough to deserve
it. Suddenly he saw the queen, and was so
overcome by her beauty&mdash;so he said in his speech&mdash;that
he could only fall down on his knees before
her and beg her pardon. He gave her his keys
and called his six trumpeters to announce the
arrival of so wondrous a being.</p>

<p>On two sides of the castle there was a beautiful
pool, and as the queen stepped upon the bridge
that crossed an arm of the mere, a sudden light
gleamed far out on the lake, and over the quiet
water came a little floating island, all ablaze with
torches. On the island was the fair Lady of the
Lake, and with her were two attendant nymphs.
The Lady recited a pretty poem to the purport
that ever since King Arthur’s days she had been
hidden, not daring to come forth, but now a royal
guest had come for whom she could feel as deep
a love as for Arthur himself. She <span class="locked">ended:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Pass on, madame, you need no longer stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lake, the lodge, the lord are yours for to command.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
With all her quickness of wit, Elizabeth could
think of no better reply than, “We had thought
the lake had been ours; and do you call it yours
now? Well, we will herein commune more with
you hereafter.” Then came a great flourish of
shawms, cornets, and other musical instruments,
and the queen passed on. She was as eager as a
child to see what was to be the next sight, for
nothing gave her more pleasure than these displays.</p>

<p>Everyone was interested in mythology in those
days, and no entertainment was regarded as complete
without some reference to the gods and
goddesses; cooks often represented in their pastry
scenes from the stories of the early deities. Elizabeth’s
way now led over a bridge that crossed
the lower court and extended to the entrance of
the castle. On either hand were seven pairs of
wooden pillars, each pair loaded with the gift
of some god. On the first pair were the tokens of
Sylvanus, god of the woodfowl; these were great
cages containing various kinds of birds, alive and
fluttering in the glare of the torches. Then came
Pomona’s treasures, two large silver bowls full
of the fairest apples, pears, cherries and nuts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
White and red grapes represented the welcome of
Bacchus, while on the fifth pair of pillars were the
gifts of Neptune, herring, oysters, and mullets,
for the god of the sea as well as the deities of
the woods and the fields had been summoned to
give greeting to Elizabeth. Mars was not forgotten;
well polished bows and arrows, gleaming
swords and spears shone in the flaring lights. The
last pillars bore the offering of Apollo, the cornet,
flute, and harp, the lute, viol, and shawm.</p>

<p>At the end of this bridge was an arch whereon
was written a lengthy welcome in Latin. The
letters were white, but wherever the queen’s name
appeared, it shone out in yellow gold. Leicester
had no idea of trusting the flickering light of
torches to reveal all these elaborate preparations
for the queen’s reception, and beside the arch
stood a poet with a wreath of bays on his head.
His part was to explain to her what each offering
signified and to read the inscription over the
gateway. It is to be hoped that the lights shone
upon him well and clearly, for he was attired in
all the splendor of a long robe of blue silk with
sleeves flowing widely to reveal glimpses of his
gorgeous crimson doublet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
As the queen alighted from her horse and entered
the castle, every clock in the building was
stopped, perhaps to suggest that she would never
grow old, that even time had no power over her.
She was escorted to her rooms, and then came the
welcome of Jupiter, king of the gods. This
was peal after peal of the guns of the castle and
a display of fireworks. For two long hours this
greeting of Jupiter’s blazed and roared, but it was
none too long to please the woman for whom it
had been planned.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday, and the queen went
to church, but in the afternoon came music and
dancing, and at night more fireworks, stars and
streams and hail of fire and burning darts flashing
through the darkness. This was only the beginning
of the festivities. The next afternoon
there was a hunt, and many a deer was slain to
amuse the royal guest. A “savage man,” covered
with moss and ivy, came out of the forest
as she was riding back to the castle and made her
a long speech, declaring that never before had he
seen so glorious a sight. He called nymphs and
fauns and dryads and satyrs to his aid, but no
one could tell the meaning of the vision. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
last he held a conversation with Echo, and learned
how mighty a queen was before him. Then he
made another speech about her wondrous beauty,
her grace and manner, and the rare qualities of her
mind. Finally, to show his submission, he broke
his stick into pieces. Unfortunately, this action
startled the queen’s horse. There was confusion
for a moment, and all flocked around in utter dismay
lest some harm had befallen her. “No hurt,
no hurt,” said Elizabeth graciously, and the officer
who wrote the account of the visit says,
“These words were the best part of the play.”</p>

<p>There was a mock fight; some Italians gave an
exhibition of “leaps, springs, and windings,” and
so agile were they that the chronicler says it
could hardly be distinguished whether they were
“man or spirit.” There was a bridal procession
of a rustic couple who were delighted to have the
opportunity to appear before the queen. The
groom was “lame of a leg broken in his youth
at football,” but he made up for the loss by wearing
a mighty pair of harvest gloves to show that
he was a good husbandman, while on his back
was slung a pen and inkhorn to indicate that he
was “bookish.” On his head was a straw hat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
with a crown made steeple-shape. He and his
bride were escorted by the young folk of the
parish, each man wearing a bit of green broom
fastened to his left arm, and carrying an alder
pole in his right hand by way of spear. One
wore a hat, another a cap; one rejoiced in a coat
or a jerkin, while another had only doublet and
hose; one had boots without spurs, and another
had spurs without boots, while a third had neither;
but it was a merry time, for were they not all
come to display themselves before the glorious
queen?</p>

<p>So the days went on. There was another
scene on the lake when a dolphin, eighty feet long,
came swimming up to meet Elizabeth. On his
back was the god Arion, who had come from
regions far away that he might sing to her, and
within the machine were six players with their
instruments. There was a show of bear-baiting,
wherein thirteen bears tied to stakes, were attacked
by a company of dogs trained for the purpose.
To see them clawing and tumbling and
growling and scratching and biting, to note the
bears’ watchfulness for their enemies and the
dogs’ keenness in getting the better of the bears,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
was what the letter-writing official called “a very
pleasant sport.” This seems to have been the
general opinion of the cruel amusement, for a
bear-baiting was often arranged as a treat for the
entertainment of foreign ambassadors and other
national guests of rank and dignity.</p>

<p>The day’s pastime was often closed by thundering
peals of guns and by fireworks that would
“mount in the air and burn in the water.” Often
the whole castle was illuminated by candle, fire,
and torchlight, as if the god of the sun himself&mdash;so
said one who was there&mdash;was resting in its
chambers instead of taking his nightly course to
the antipodes. There was surely no lack of
amusements, and indeed several spectacles had
been planned for which there was no time. One
man who was to represent a minstrel of the olden
days was sorely grieved because he could not
have the honor of singing before the queen. He
found what comfort he might, however, in showing
his skill to a company of the courtiers. One
of them described his appearance, and a reader
cannot help feeling sorry that Queen Elizabeth
lost the sight. The “ancient minstrel” wore a
long, flowing robe of green, gathered at the throat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
and fastened with a clasp. The wide sleeves
were slit from shoulder to hand, and under them
was a closely fitting undersleeve of white cotton.
He wore a black worsted doublet, confined
at the waist by a wide red girdle. His shoes were
“not new indeed, but shining,” though perhaps
not quite so brilliantly as was his hair, for that
had been smoothed with a sponge “dipped in a
little bear’s grease” till it gleamed like a duck’s
wing. He wore a shirt whose bosom was ruffled,
and starched “after the new trink,” till every
ruffle stood up stiff and “glittering.” A handkerchief
was thrust into his bosom, but enough
of it was displayed to show that it was edged with
bright blue lace and marked with a heart. Around
his neck was a broad red ribbon which held his
harp, while on a green lacing hung the tuning
key. It was really a pity that the queen lost all
this display.</p>

<p>The chief reason for Elizabeth’s pleasure in
these progresses was probably her delight in all
pageants and thorough enjoyment of her popularity
among the people. At such times she
was nearer to them than at any others. The
humblest servant in the castle where she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
making her stay, the simplest peasant of the
countryside, had as free access to her Majesty
as the greatest of her nobles. Anyone might
bring her a petition, anyone might offer her a
gift; and no matter of how slight value the
present might be, its donor was never disappointed
in the gracious thanks that he hoped to
receive from his sovereign. Often sufferers from
scrofula were brought before her with the prayer
that she would but lay her hand upon them, for
England had believed for six hundred years that
the touch of the royal hand would cure this disease.
It was said that on Elizabeth’s visit to
Kenilworth she healed nine.</p>

<p>This was only one of the many superstitions of
the Elizabethan times. A bit of the wood of
which the gallows was made would cure the ague;
wearing a topaz stone would bring an insane
man to his right mind; a verse of the Bible written
on parchment and worn about the neck would
drive away evil spirits; to carry fern-seed in the
pocket would enable a man to “go invisible.”
Powdered diamonds would heal one disease; wiping
the face with a red cloth another; while pills
made of the powdered skull of a man that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
been hanged were a sure remedy for a third. Not
only the ignorant but most of the most learned
men of the day believed firmly in astrology, and
the home of the queen’s astrologer, Dr. Dee,
was often crowded with nobles who were
eager to know the fates foretold to them by the
heavens. There was so firm a belief in witchcraft
that one of the queen’s bishops preached before
her on the subject, telling her what sufferings
her subjects were enduring from witches. “They
pine away even unto the death,” said he, and he
begged her Majesty to make a law providing
for the punishment of sorcerers. This was done,
or rather, an old law was revived. When Elizabeth
had a toothache, many of her advisers declared
that the pain had been produced by magic,
and it was suggested that the treatment of waxen
images of the queen at the hands of some who
were ill-disposed toward her was the reason for
her sufferings. The royal physicians could not
agree upon the cause of the trouble or upon a
remedy, and the matter was ended by the council
of state taking charge of the affair and ordering
a prescription from a foreign physician.</p>

<p>At the time of Queen Elizabeth’s progress to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Kenilworth, a banquet was arranged for her.
One of her courtiers says that it was neither
well served nor nicely set down, that it was “disorderly
wasted and coarsely consumed,” that it
was carried on “more curtly than courteously;”
but he adds, “If it might please and be liked and
do that it came for, then was all well enough.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Kenilworth in Elizabeth’s time.&mdash;<i>From an old print.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The Elizabethan life was a strange mingling
of magnificence and discomfort. There were
most palatial mansions with noble towers and
gateways and terraces, with lawns and gardens
and fountains and parks and wide-spreading
acres of hill and dale, of field and forest, but according
to modern ideas there was little comfort
in all this splendor. The only way to warm these
lordly castles was by an occasional fireplace, and
the rooms were full of drafts that even the heavy
tapestry hung on the walls would not prevent.
Cleanliness was almost unknown. Floors were
strewn with rushes, and when a room was to be
put in order, fresh rushes were brought in, but no
one thought it at all necessary to carry away
the old ones. A room was almost never swept
unless space was needed for dancing; then a
circle in the middle was cleared of rushes, dirt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
dust, crumbs and bones from the dining table and
all sorts of rubbish that had accumulated since
the time of the last merrymaking. One letter-writer
of the day declared that the rushes on floors
not needed for dancing were sometimes left for
twenty years without being swept away. Whoever
could afford it owned several country houses,
and when one became absolutely unendurable,
even according to sixteenth century notions, he
would move to another to let the first house
“sweeten,” as was said.</p>

<p>The list of different kinds of food purchased for
the queen’s progress gives an idea of what the
rich folk ate, that is, what they ate in the summer.
In the winter they had little besides salt
meat, various kinds of bread, and the most remarkable
pies that one ever heard of. They were
made of everything from artichokes to herring.
One pastry is described as made of fish and flavored
with pepper, ginger, and cloves. The artichoke
pies were made of a combination of artichokes,
marrow, ginger, raisins and dates. Few
vegetables were used. Potatoes had been brought
from America, but they were regarded as a luxury.
They were roasted in the embers or else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
boiled and eaten with pepper, oil, and vinegar.
There was neither tea nor coffee; beer or wine was
drunk at every meal. People ate with knives and
fingers, for forks did not appear until near the
end of Elizabeth’s life. One that was richly
jeweled was presented to her and was kept in a
glass case as a curiosity.</p>

<p>The homes of the poor were indeed bare and
comfortless. The floors were of clay or beaten
earth. A clumsy table, some wooden stools, a
wooden trencher to hold the food, a pile of straw
to sleep on, salt fish and rye or barley bread&mdash;these
were all the comforts that a poor man could
expect to have in his home. The house itself
was built of boughs of trees interwoven with
willow twigs and daubed with clay. The fire
was made against a rock set into one of the walls,
and the smoke found its way out as best it could.
Before the reign of Elizabeth was over, chimneys
had become more common, and many men whose
fathers had lived in huts of mud and had eaten
from wooden trenchers were building for themselves
houses of oak with the comfort of a chimney
and perhaps the elegance of a pewter porringer
or two among their wooden dishes. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
best the luxuries were not very luxurious, but a
writer of the time lamented that men were no
longer as brave and strong as they used to be, and
thought their weakness was due to these dainty
and enfeebling fashions.</p>

<span class="subhead">ELIZABETH’S SUITORS</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Never</span> before did the hand of a woman
and its possible bestowal in marriage
play so important a part in the affairs of
Europe as did that of Elizabeth. She contrived
to delay and postpone giving an answer to Philip
till his minister wrote home wrathfully, “The
English queen is possessed of ten thousand
devils,” but at the death of Philip’s third wife, ten
years later, she was not at all displeased when
the Spanish ambassador suggested pointedly that
Philip was “still young enough to take a fourth
wife.” When France was showing too much
favor to Scotland to suit English notions, she
was fully capable of discussing the possibility of
a Scotch husband, and when there was a whisper
that one foreign ruler meditated the rescue of the
captive Mary and a marriage with her, Elizabeth
at once sent an agent to him to suggest a marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
with herself. Whenever her fears of Spain increased,
she began to think of a French alliance.
There was always a French suitor ready, for
Catherine de Medicis was trying her best to
persuade Elizabeth to choose one of the French
princes for a husband.</p>

<p>The English queen kept one suitor waiting in
uncertainty for seven years, another for eleven.
She had all sorts of absurd names for her admirers;
one was her “lap-dog,” one her “tame cat,”
one her “sheep,” another her “frog.” Occasionally
she found a wooer who was not so ready
as the others to await her royal pleasure. Three
years after all negotiations with the Archduke
Charles, brother of the German emperor, had been
broken off, she was talking familiarly with some
of the ladies of the bedchamber, and she said
with some <span class="locked">indignation:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The king of France is to marry one daughter
of the emperor, and the king of Spain is to marry
another.”</p>

<p>“There’s many a noble marriage, your Majesty,”
said one of her ladies. “Would that there
was one more,” she added slily.</p>

<p>“These royal brides have near of kin to promote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
their interests,” replied Elizabeth. “What
can a woman alone do for herself, whether she is
on a throne or on a wooden stool?”</p>

<p>“Your Grace has full many a faithful servant,”
answered the lady, “who would be ready to give
life and limb to do your will.”</p>

<p>“And yet with all these honorable marriages
a-making, not one man in the council had the
wit to remind the rest that the emperor has a
brother,” said the queen and turned away
abruptly. The lady understood what was expected
of her, and she sent at once for the Earl of
Leicester.</p>

<p>“Would you do aught to gratify her Majesty?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Is there aught that I would not do to gratify
her Majesty&mdash;or yourself?” he added with a gallant
bow. The lady repeated the conversation.</p>

<p>The next day a humble petition came from the
<span class="locked">council:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Far be it from the intentions of your Majesty’s
servants to suggest anything displeasing
to your Grace, but if it be in accordance with your
will, it would be highly gratifying to your councilors,
should you grant this their humble petition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
that your Highness will consider the matter
of the Archduke Charles and the suit that he so
recently made.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth <span class="locked">replied:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Of my own will the thought of marriage has
ever been far from me, but I cannot refuse the
request of my councilors in whose judgment I
have so much confidence.”</p>

<p>An ambassador was sent at once to the German
emperor with the <span class="locked">message:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The queen of England regrets deeply that her
frequent illnesses, the wars in France and Flanders,
and difficult matters in her own government
have prevented her from returning a final answer
to the suit of his imperial Majesty’s brother. If
he is pleased to come to England, he will be most
welcome, and she doubts not that her subjects can
be persuaded to permit him the free exercise of
his own religion.”</p>

<p>“It is a pleasure,” returned the emperor, “to
send to her Majesty, the queen of England, assurances
of my warmest regard. Most highly
do I esteem the honor of receiving a message from
a sovereign of such beauty of face and greatness
of mind;” and then he continued, not without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
little enjoyment it may be, “My brother is most
grateful for her Majesty’s good intentions toward
him, but he would say that after a delay of three
years he had supposed that she did not wish to
accept his suit, and he is now engaged to a princess
of his own faith, but he earnestly hopes that
the queen will ever regard him as a brother.”</p>

<p>The youthful envoy was presented with a silver
vessel and treated with all courtesy, but these
attentions to her ambassador did not soothe the
rage of Elizabeth. “If I were a man,” she
stormed, “and the emperor had offered me such
an insult, I would have called him out to single
combat.”</p>

<p>The last of Elizabeth’s wooers was the Duke of
Alençon. Catherine de Medicis had tried hard
to win the hand of the queen for an older son who
was not at all eager for the honor. When this
plan failed, Catherine wrote to her minister in
England: “Would she have my son Alençon?
He is turned of sixteen, though but little for his
age.” She went on to say that “this youth had the
understanding, visage, and demeanor of one much
older than he is.” Elizabeth was thirty-eight, and
when the scheme was first proposed to Cecil, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
exclaimed, “Why, it would look like a mother
with her son.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth never refused a suitor at once, and
she demanded full information about the Duke
of Alençon. “How tall is he?” she asked. The
duke was really so stunted as to be almost
dwarfed; he had an enormous nose, a wide mouth,
and a face scarred by the smallpox.</p>

<p>“I have waited a long time,” said the queen,
“and if I should now marry a man so much
younger than myself and so badly marked with
the pox, indeed I know not what they would say.”</p>

<p>“The duke is growing older every day,” replied
the French ambassador, “and in London
there is a learned physician who declares that in
two or three days he can remove all traces of the
disease. The duke’s heart is full of love and admiration
for your Majesty. If I might venture,
but no&mdash;&mdash;” and he thrust back into his pocket a
paper that he had partly drawn forth.</p>

<p>“What is that?” demanded Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Pardon, your Majesty, but it is a paper that
I have no right to show. This is but the private
letter of the duke, and was not meant to fall under
the eyes of your Grace.” Finally he was prevailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
upon to give her the paper, which proved
to be a note&mdash;written expressly for the purpose&mdash;from
Alençon to a friend in France. She read
and reread.</p>

<p>“That is a fair penmanship,” said she. “That
is marvelously well done.”</p>

<p>“And the matter of the letter,” asked the ambassador,
“is not that, too, well done? It is but
the outpourings of an honest heart and of its
longings to win your Grace for himself.”</p>

<p>“It is very fairly written,” said Elizabeth, and
she ended the audience, but she did not return
the note.</p>

<p>The duke wrote many letters to the queen, and
they do have an air of sincerity and earnestness
that is different from the writings of some of
Elizabeth’s suitors. Catherine sent word that the
learned doctor from London was doing much to
improve the appearance of her son’s face, but
she wished to be sure that the medicines were
harmless. “He can easily practise on a page,”
she wrote, “and if it does well, he can use his
remedies on my son.” The French ambassador
hastened to tell the good news to Elizabeth, but
this disappointing sovereign replied coolly, “I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
really surprised that so loving a mother did not
attempt sooner to remove so great a disfigurement.”</p>

<p>One June day a young man with two servants
appeared at Elizabeth’s gates and demanded to
see the queen. It was Alençon himself, and she
was delighted. Of all her wooers not one before
had ever dared to come to England and run the
risk of a refusal, but “Monsieur,” as the English
called him, had shown himself so bold that the
queen was charmed. He was homely, there was
no denying it, but he was brave and gallant,
quick and sprightly, and one of the best flatterers
that had ever been at the English court.
His reception and entertainment were most cordial,
and he went home in full expectation of
marrying the queen.</p>

<p>Not long after this visit Elizabeth called her
council to consider the marriage. Cecil in his
usual methodical fashion drew up a paper with
the advantages on the left and the disadvantages
on the right. Finally the council reported to the
sovereign that they would try to “conform themselves”
to whatever she wished. Then the queen
was angry, for she had expected them to urge her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
to marry. She cried and she stormed. She told
her councilors that they cared nothing at all for
her safety and the welfare of the kingdom. They
bore her wrath with the utmost humility, but
they did not change their report. Neither did
the queen change her mind, and the marriage
treaty was drawn up. The councilors did not
despair even then, and one evening a well-arranged
scene took place after the queen had retired
to her chamber. Her ladies fell on their
knees around her. They sobbed and groaned.</p>

<p>“Oh, your Majesty,” said one, “such a step
cannot bring you happiness.”</p>

<p>“The duke is so young,” lamented another.
“He knows not how to conceive of your greatness.
He will despise you and scorn you because
he cannot appreciate such rare excellence of mind.
Only a king should be your husband.”</p>

<p>“Your Majesty, do not forget Queen Mary,”
one wailed. “Think of her misery, and do not
bring another foreigner into the land.”</p>

<p>“How can a queen be governor of the Protestant
church and promise to obey a Catholic
spouse?” asked one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
Elizabeth turned sharply away without a word,
but in the morning she sent for the duke.</p>

<p>“Your Grace,” said he with great concern, “it
grieves me to the heart to see you pale and
tearful.”</p>

<p>“Good reason have I for pallor,” said she,
“for two more nights like the last would bring
me to the grave. The woman who lives in a
cottage may wed whom she will; the queen of
England must wed to please her subjects.”</p>

<p>The duke dashed away to his own apartment.
“England may well be an island,” he exclaimed,
“for the women are as changeable as the waves
that encircle it.” The queen had given him a
ring, and now he threw it into the farthest corner
of the room. He would have left England at
once, but Elizabeth would not permit him to go,
and when after three months he declared that he
would stay no longer, she persisted in going to
Canterbury with him, much against his will. He
left her weeping, and while he was crossing the
Channel, she was writing a poem <span class="locked">beginning:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“I grieve yet dare not show my discontent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I love, and yet am forced to seem to hate.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
“Monsieur” was the last of Elizabeth’s suitors.
Eleven years had passed since his marriage with
the queen had first been discussed. She was now
fifty years of age; the country settled into the
belief that she would never marry, and most
people expected that the next ruler of England
would be the son of Mary, the prisoner.</p>

<p>No one knows whether Elizabeth was in earnest
or not in any of the plans for her marriage. Leicester
said: “Should she decide to marry, I am
all but convinced that she would choose no other
than myself,&mdash;at least, she has done me the honor
to say as much&mdash;but I know not what to hope or
what to fear.” In the early part of her reign her
subjects were nearly equally divided into Catholics
and Protestants. It was her policy to be a
Protestant, but to do nothing that would arouse
the Catholics against her, as a Protestant marriage
would surely have done. If on the other
hand she had chosen a Catholic, then the ruling
power of the country would have been enraged.
She declared over and over that she would never
marry one of her own subjects, and she had not
forgotten the indignation of the English when
Mary persisted in marrying a foreigner. Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
things were worth more to this queen than all
else in the world; one was the love of her subjects,
the other was her own power. Any marriage
that she might make would deprive her in
some degree of one or the other. Her word
could not always be trusted, but there is certainly
some reason for believing that she was truthful
in declaring that she did not mean to marry, and
that if she changed her mind, it would be only
to obey the demand of the country.</p>

<p>At the same time she enjoyed fancying herself
in love with one or another. She demanded the
utmost adoration from her courtiers. Few men
could be comfortable at her court who did not
bow down to her as the wisest, wittiest, most
brilliant, most beautiful of women. When half
of Europe was raving over the beauty of Mary,
Queen of Scots, Elizabeth did her best to oblige
Mary’s ambassador to admit that she herself was
far more lovely. She often spoke of herself as
the “old woman,” but woe to the courtier who
did not hasten to assure her that such beauty as
hers could never change, that each day only made
her more radiant. She was always indignant
when any of her courtiers ventured to marry, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
perhaps this wrath was not so very illogical, for
when they had assured her hundreds of times that
all other beauty paled before hers, that nothing in
the world save the radiance of her smile could
cheer their lives, how could she help being enraged
when they proved by marriage that her
favor alone would not raise them to the heights of
happiness? At last even her favorite Leicester
married. Then Elizabeth raged. She sent him
to prison, and would have committed him to the
Tower, had not one of her most trusted councilors
opposed her lawless proceedings so
strongly.</p>

<p>The older Elizabeth grew, the more gorgeous
became her raiment. When she was living quietly
at Hatfield House with Mary wearing the crown,
she dressed with exceeding plainness and simplicity.
It was her best policy then to attract as
little notice as possible; but when she was once
safely on the throne, she showed herself a true
daughter of Henry VIII. in her love of magnificence.
She thoroughly enjoyed riding through
streets hung with tapestry; she liked to see flags
and streamers fluttering from the windows of the
houses; processions, pageants, shows of all kinds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
were her delight. As she proved at Kenilworth,
she could partake of a public banquet, ride on a
hunt for half a day, listen to addresses of welcome
and explanation of spectacles produced in
her honor; and after so well-filled a day she could
hear the thunder of guns and watch the flashing
of fireworks for two hours longer without the
least sign of weariness.</p>

<p>It is true that when she was alone with her
ladies, she was satisfied with a comparatively
simple dress, but when she was in public and felt
herself part of the magnificence, nothing could
be too sumptuous. Cloth of silver, cloth of gold,
the richest of Italian velvet, the heaviest of silk,
these were her robes, and there were fully two
thousand of them. Nor were they plain in their
richness; some were covered with pictures of eyes
and ears to suggest that whatever was said or
done in the land would come to the knowledge
of the queen. Some were covered with embroidered
illustrations of tales from mythology,
or various devices that were full of some hidden
significance. Aglets of all kinds adorned her
gowns, as did buttons and clasps made of gold
and enameled or set lavishly with diamonds or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
pearls or rubies. Her various kinds of head-dresses
were marvels, for they were so a-glitter
with precious stones. While Mary of Scotland
was a captive, she sent Elizabeth a new year’s
gift of a net-work head-dress which she herself
had made. A little later the French ambassador
brought the queen three embroidered nightcaps,
also made by the fair hands of Mary.</p>

<p>“In faith, I thank the Queen of Scots,” said
Elizabeth, “but my council be now but scarce
recovered from their commotion and jealousy because
you brought me a new year’s gift from the
same lady.”</p>

<p>The disappointed ambassador went home with
the nightcaps, but at the next call his luck was
better. Elizabeth had determined to accept the
pretty present, whether the act pleased her council
or not. “Tell the Queen of Scots,” said she,
“that I am older than she is. When people
arrive at my age, they take all they can get with
both hands, and only give with their little finger.”
This was indeed true, for Elizabeth’s hand was
always open to a gift, especially to one of personal
adornment. When her godson would win
a favor from her, he presented her with a “heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
of gold, garnished with sparks of rubies.” Her
silk-woman brought her one new year’s day a pair
of black silk stockings, a rare luxury even for a
queen, since Spain was the home of silk stockings,
and from the land of Elizabeth’s rejected
suitor and her country’s enemy but few pairs
made their way to England.</p>

<p>“Where did you get the stockings?” asked
Elizabeth with delight.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” she answered, “I once saw
a pair brought from Spain, and I made these expressly
for your Grace.”</p>

<p>“Can you get me more?” asked the queen
eagerly.</p>

<p>“This very day,” replied the silk-woman joyfully,
“I will set up another pair, and knit more
for your Grace.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wear no more stockings made of cloth,”
declared the queen. “These are pleasant and
delicate. I mind me well that my father had two
pairs, and by great chance there came a pair from
Spain while my brother Edward was king. No
more cloth hose for me, good Mistress Montague.”</p>

<p>One of the queen’s bold sea-captains presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
her with a fan made of red and white feathers,
“enameled with a half-moon of mother-of-pearl,
within that a half-moon garnished with sparks of
diamonds and a few seed pearls.” A fan was
once given to her by Leicester which was even
more dazzling. It was made of white feathers;
its handle was of gold; rubies, diamonds, and two
superb emeralds were on one side; rubies, diamonds,
and pearls were on the other. Leicester’s
coat of arms was a bear and ragged staff; therefore,
there was a lion rampant with a white bear
lying muzzled at its feet. A pair of gloves was
in those days a fitting offering “to set before the
queen.” Handkerchiefs, a kind of nightdress
that must have served as a wrapper, for it was of
white linen embroidered with black and trimmed
with lace and spangles, preserved ginger, lemons,
pies, a purse of gold coins from a wealthy city or
a piece of confectionery from her cook,&mdash;whatever
came was welcome.</p>

<p>To live in splendor was the queen’s paradise.
Her books were bound in velvet, their clasps were
of gold or of silver, and wherever there was space,
the glitter of some precious stone flashed forth.
Handsome furniture, fine tapestries, golden plate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
were her joy. The trappings of her horses were
superb; the harness was of gold and silk, the
saddle was of black velvet embroidered with
pearls and gold thread. It was valued at seven
thousand dollars. Preparing her dinner table
was an elaborate ceremonial. Each article of
table use must be brought in by a servant preceded
by an usher, and before it could be laid on the
table, the servant must kneel three times. After
it was put in place, the servant knelt once, and
then the little procession returned for another
article. When it was time for the food to be
brought in, there was much more ceremony.
Silken-clad lady “tasters,” tall yeomen of the
guard, and eight maids of honor appeared.
Drums and trumpets sounded, and then the food&mdash;rather
cold, one would fancy&mdash;was borne in
state to the chamber of the queen.</p>

<p>With all this love of magnificence Elizabeth
had a thrifty notion of the value of economy in
the adornments of others, and several times during
her reign she had laws passed forbidding
expensive attire. One of her proclamations
stated that it caused “great inconvenience” to
spend so much for dress, and that men were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
arraying their wives and children at so much
“superfluous charge and expense” that they were
no longer able to practise hospitality as they
ought. “The lowest ought not to expect to dress
as richly as their betters,” declared the queen.
“It is their pride that makes them rob and steal
by the highway.”</p>

<p>She even told her subjects just what materials
they would be allowed to wear. Save for a few
exceptions, ambassadors or commanders or
Knights of the Garter, no one but an earl was
allowed to wear purple silk or cloth of gold or
of silver “tissued.” No one below the rank of
baron might dare to adorn himself with gold or
silver lace, or wear a sword or rapier or dagger.
The wife of a knight was permitted to appear in
a velvet gown, cloak, or other upper garment,
and she might embroider them with silk if she
chose, but the wife of even a knight’s eldest son
could wear velvet only as a kirtle or petticoat.
Her upper garment might be of satin, but she
was forbidden to embroider it.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was not afraid to rebuke her ladies
in waiting if their dress was too expensive to
please her. One of them bought a velvet suit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
elaborately trimmed with gold and pearls. Elizabeth
bore its appearance several times, then she
had it brought to her secretly and put it on. Out
among her ladies she went, wearing the elaborate
gown, which was much too short for her. The
owner of the velvet and pearls was aghast, but
the queen smiled upon her and <span class="locked">asked:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Think you not, Mistress Mary, that my gown
is too short? Does it not become me ill?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your Majesty,” faltered the poor lady.</p>

<p>“You are right,” said the queen, “but mark
you well that if it is too short for me, it is too
fine for you.” The gown never again appeared
before the eyes of the queen.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE GREAT SEA-CAPTAINS</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">As</span> matters are looked at in these times,
Elizabeth’s relations to Spain were exceedingly
strange. To-day if two countries
are not at war, they are at peace, but in
the sixteenth century it was not at all uncommon
for two rulers to annoy each other as much as
possible without any formal war, and more than
once a third country joined one side or the other
because in so doing there was an opportunity
for gain.</p>

<p>Philip would have been glad to conquer England,
but as long as Elizabeth maintained peace
with France, there was little hope for him. Moreover,
the Netherlands were keeping his hands
full, and what was most exasperating, Elizabeth
was helping the revolters. There was one more
thing to be considered, if Philip did conquer England,
there was no hope of his being able to claim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
the throne as long as Mary was alive. So it was
that this ruler of half Europe, was really at the
mercy of that exasperating monarch, Elizabeth of
England, and she hectored and tormented him to
her heart’s content. Early in her reign most of
her advisers would have been glad to go to
war with Philip, but Elizabeth delayed. She
hated war. Every year of peace enriched and
strengthened her kingdom, and moreover, even
without fighting Philip, she was gaining much
of the wealth and power that a Spanish conquest
would have brought her.</p>

<p>This gain came about through the exploits of
her sea-captains. As has been said before, it
was regarded as an honorable occupation to get
some negroes on the African coast, carry them
to the Spanish colonies in America, and sell them
for a goodly amount of Spanish gold. This was
precisely what Sir John Hawkins did, but when
he had leisurely made his way back to England,
he found himself in trouble. Elizabeth sent for
him.</p>

<p>“They tell me you are no better than a pirate,”
she said, bluntly, although her look was not so
stern as Cecil would have wished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
“Your Majesty,” replied Hawkins, “I am but
a plain, simple sailor.”</p>

<p>“And so my plain, simple sailors are bringing
me into a war with King Philip?” asked Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Hawkins was no more afraid of the queen of
England than of the king of Spain, and he told his
own grievances as frankly as if she had been one
of his men.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” said he, “I took the blacks
from the savage countries of Africa, and surely
there was no harm in that. I carried them to
Saint Domingo, and I sold them to the planters.
The governor of the island was willing, and the
planters were glad to get them. I paid the harbor
dues, and I left one hundred negroes with him to
pay a larger duty if the king asked more of an
Englishman than he did of a Spaniard. I bought
hides with the money and sent them in a Spanish
vessel to be sold in Spain. The king seized them,
and he won’t pay me a penny for them.”</p>

<p>“Well, my plain, simple sailor,” asked the
queen, “is it your will that I and my council
should go to Spain and get your hides?”</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” he answered, “give me a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
good vessel under me and plenty of sea-room, and
I’ll trouble no council to care for me and my
right.” Elizabeth was in a rarely good-natured
mood. She patted the captain on his broad
shoulder.</p>

<p>“I’d gladly know what the king of Spain
would do with such a saucy fellow as you,” she
said. “You’d better go home and think no more
about the New World. One side of the Atlantic
is enough for a man.” The captain withdrew, but
Elizabeth bade an attendant call him back.</p>

<p>“Let me understand when it is your will to go
on another trip,” she said, “for no one could
expect a pirate to obey his queen, and then, too, I
have a vessel that might be the better for a voyage
or two, even in the hands of a simple sailor like
yourself.”</p>

<p>Cecil objected and the Spanish ambassador
raged, but it was not long before Hawkins set out
on another voyage, this time in a great ship of
the queen’s, and she as well as many of her council
took shares in the enterprise. “See you to it
that you do no wrong to the king of Spain,” were
the queen’s orders, but she lent the commander
one hundred good soldiers. When Hawkins came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
back in all the glory of a successful voyage and
with bags of Spanish coins for queen and councilors,
he was invited to dine with his sovereign.
The Spanish ambassador was also dining at court,
but he could have had little pleasure in his dinner,
for he was thinking of what he should have to
write to the king of Spain. What Philip said
when the letters reached him no one knows, but
whenever he came to the name of Hawkins, he
wrote on the margin “Beware, beware!”</p>

<p>On one of Hawkins’s voyages went a kinsman
of his own named Francis Drake. He was a
young man of medium height, with broad shoulders,
reddish beard, and keen, kindly eyes. The
voyage on which he went was unsuccessful, for
a Spanish ship set upon the Englishmen and
robbed them. Worse than that, there were not
provisions enough to last on the trip home, and
one hundred of his comrades volunteered to take
their chances on the land that the rest of the company
might be sure of safety.</p>

<p>Drake made up his mind that the king of Spain
should pay for his own lost investment and his
kinsman’s captured hides to say nothing of reprisal
for the suffering and perhaps death of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
hundred brave men who had sacrificed themselves
for their comrades. He did very little talking
about his plans, but there were sailors enough in
Plymouth who were ready to go anywhere with
him, and he had friends who were willing to invest
in any undertaking that he would lead. He
set sail for America.</p>

<p>He was not going out vaguely into the west,
hoping that somewhere he might pick up something
worth bringing home, he had a very definite
plan. He sailed straight for Panama and landed.
There he waited. While he was waiting, he
climbed a tall tree one day, and far to the westward
the Pacific Ocean spread out before him.
“If the almighty God will give me life,” said he,
“I’ll sail a ship in those waters before many
years.”</p>

<p>After a while he and his men heard bits of
Spanish song, the tinkling of bells on the necks of
mules, and the sound of the feet of the animals
striking upon the well-trodden path. Then the
English dashed out, for this was King Philip’s
treasure train that once a year paced leisurely up
the path with the output of the mines, with gold,
silver, emeralds, and diamonds. There were more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
than the ship could carry, says the old story. The
ship could easily come again, the ocean was free;
so they buried the great bars of silver and steered
for England.</p>

<p>When Drake arrived, he made no boast of what
he had done, he divided the treasure and did no
talking. He read books on geography, he studied
charts and globes, he questioned seamen who had
been on the farther side of the ocean, and he had
more than one interview with the queen and different
members of her council. To agree as a
council to support Drake would be to declare war
against Spain, and it would not answer to have
the names of the councilors who invested in the
enterprise made public, but many a one among
them, and even the queen herself was ready to
fill a coffer or two with good Spanish gold.</p>

<p>The preparations were so unusual that the voyage
could not be kept secret. “I pray your Majesty,”
wrote the Spanish ambassador to Philip,
“I pray you order your planters in the New World
to hang every Englishman upon whom they can
lay hands, and bid your sailors sink every ship
that comes in their sight.”</p>

<p>The two vessels, one of one hundred and twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
tons and one of eighty tons, with three little
sloops, were made ready. Everything about them
was put in the best order possible for fighting or
for sailing. Luxuries were not forgotten, for this
keen young sailor did not scorn the elegancies of
life. There was handsome furniture finely carved.
There was a beautiful silver service for his table,
every piece engraved with the arms of his family.
His cooking utensils were of silver. He had a
liberal supply of perfumes, many of them the
gift of the queen. Expert musicians were on
board, for this luxurious captain must dine and
sup to the sound of music.</p>

<p>With his men he was ever kindly, even affectionate,
and he was not afraid to share their
work if there was need, but they knew him for
one that could command, and they never failed in
their respect. Nine or ten men formed his council.
He decided all questions himself, but he ever
listened attentively to what they had to say. They
dined at his table, but not one of them ventured
to be seated in his presence or to wear a hat without
the invitation of their commander. November
15, 1577, the little fleet set sail at five o’clock
in the afternoon&mdash;on a one day’s voyage it proved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
for the <i>Golden Hind</i>, Drake’s own ship, was injured
in the “forcible storm and tempests” that
arose, and he had to go back to land.</p>

<p>Three years later many a man in England was
troubled about the deeds of this commander who
was so fond of perfumes and music and silver
plate, for there were stories abroad of what he
had done on the other side of the sea. Philip was
furious; the Spanish ambassador raged, and more
than one who had invested in Drake’s venture
every shilling that he could raise would have rejoiced
to lose his money if he could have been sure
that Drake would never return. In the midst of
the anxiety and uncertainty, some eager to have
him come in safely and others trembling at the
thought of his arrival, there was a mighty roaring
of the signal guns at Plymouth Harbor, for Drake
had returned, and he had been around the world.</p>

<p>On a little hill, somewhat withdrawn from the
crowd that stood shouting and cheering to see the
ship come in, stood two men, the elder grave and
troubled, the younger eager and excited.</p>

<p>“I verily believe,” said the elder, “that you
would willingly be among those doltish screamers
on the shore yonder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
“It’s not so bad a thing, is it, for a man to
know that his money has come back to him
doubled ten, twelve, perhaps a hundred times?
It’s little wonder that they scream.”</p>

<p>“That goes as it may,” returned the elder, “but
the gold in that vessel is devil’s gold. If half the
tales be true, Francis Drake is no better than a
pirate. Has he not burned settlements, stolen
treasure, and sunk galleons?”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it, if they be those of Spain?”
asked the young man indifferently, shading his
eyes to see the ships more clearly.</p>

<p>“Nothing of it if a man cares for naught but
gold, nothing of it to him whose empty moneybags
are a sorer grief to him than the ill that is
sure to come to England from this wild and savage
piracy.”</p>

<p>“You mean that old leaden foot will bestir
himself?”</p>

<p>“Philip is slow, but he will strike at last.”</p>

<p>“Let him. One Englishman can meet two
Spaniards any day.”</p>

<p>“He boasts best who boasts last,” said the
elder. “Remember that every Spaniard has his
hands full of gold from the American mines.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
“And it is you yourself who are blaming Captain
Drake for taking it from them,” laughed the
young fellow gaily. “Goodby, uncle, I’m going
down among the wicked folk to see the ships come
to shore.”</p>

<p>For once the stories were not equal to the reality.
In the holds of Drake’s vessels were such
masses of treasure that men hardly ventured even
to estimate it. Vast quantities were carried to the
Tower of London. Drake made most costly gifts
to the nobles, but some of them refused to accept
anything from the “master thief of the unknown
world,” as they called him.</p>

<p>“He is nothing but a robber,” declared they,
“and he will bring war upon us.”</p>

<p>“Is it robbery, demanded others, to take from
Spain what Spain has stolen from us? How else
can a man get his rights? Has not Philip taken
our ships, hindered our commerce, captured our
sailors, and tortured them to make them give up
the true faith? Have we not a clear right to take
reprisal when and where we can?”</p>

<p>“It is a lawful prize,” reasoned others, “and if
war is to come, this Spanish gold will save taxes
and fight many a battle for us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
The Spanish ambassador went straight to
the queen and said gravely, “I present from
my master, the king of Spain, a request
that the pirate Drake be surrendered to
him.”</p>

<p>“The king of Spain is generous with his presents,”
answered Elizabeth flippantly. “For this
one I return him all due thanks.”</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” said the ambassador, “this
man Drake has sunk our ships, stolen our treasure,
and interfered with our possessions in the
New World.”</p>

<p>“If you can prove his misdeeds to my satisfaction,”
rejoined the queen with a little yawn,
“this wonderful treasure of yours shall be restored,
though one might think it was but fair
payment for the rebellions that Spain has caused
in Ireland&mdash;or does my good friend Philip claim
Ireland too for his own? As for his possessions
in the New World, I don’t know what right the
Pope has to give away continents. The sea and
the air are free to all, and neither Pope nor Spain
can keep my brave captains from sailing the ocean,
I doubt whether I could keep them from it myself.
Shall we talk of other matters? You have an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
excellent taste in music, and here is a rare bit
of song that has but newly come to <span class="locked">me:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“‘The little pretty nightingale<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Among the leaves green&mdash;’”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“Your Majesty,” broke in the exasperated ambassador,
“if I report this scene to King Philip,
matters will come to the cannon.”</p>

<p>“You really shouldn’t say such things,” said
Elizabeth with a coquettish glance at the enraged
Spaniard, and she added quietly, “If you do, I
shall have to throw you into one of my dungeons.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth made Drake a knight, she wore his
jewels in her crown, and she dined with him on
board the <i>Golden Hind</i>. She often had him at
court, and never wearied of hearing the story of
his adventures.</p>

<div id="i220" class="figcenter" style="width: 421px;">

<div class="caption"><p>Elizabeth signing the death warrant of Mary Stuart.&mdash;<i>From
painting by Liezen-Mayer.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>“Tell me of the savages,” she commanded,
and Drake <span class="locked">began:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“We saw them moving about under the trees,
and when we came near, they paddled out to meet
us. They made a long speech with many gestures,
and it seemed as if they couldn’t do us reverence
enough. The next day they came again, and this
time they brought a great ragged bunch of crow’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
feathers. The man who stood at the king’s right
hand knelt before me and touched the ground with
his forehead three times. Then he gave me the
feathers. I noticed that the king’s guards all wore
such bunches on their heads, so I stuck them in my
red cap as well as ever I could, and the savages all
danced around me and made the most unearthly
screeching that I ever heard. Then they began
to show us their wounds and sores, and made
signs that we should blow on them to heal them.
I gave them plasters and lotions. They ought to
do some good, for they were mixed on a day that
Dr. Dee said would make any medicine of worth.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about the <i>Cacafuego</i>,” bade the queen,
and Drake <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“We took a Spanish ship, and one of the sailors
said, ‘Let me go free and I will tell you such news
as you never heard before.’ I promised, and he
said, ‘There’s a ship not far ahead of you, her
name is the <i>Cacafuego</i>, and if you can catch her,
you’ll have such a prize as you never saw in a
dream&mdash;and I’ll get my revenge on her captain for
this,’ he muttered, and then he put his hand on a
great red scar on his forehead. We chased her
to Payta, but she had gone to Panama, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
we came to Panama, she was somewhere else.
‘I’ll give a gold chain to the first man that sees
her,’ I said, and, your Majesty, if I had even given
an order to drop anchor, I verily believe every
man of them would have climbed the masthead.
Well, about three o’clock one afternoon my page
John caught sight of her, and we pursued. Oh,
but it was glorious! I wish you had been there!”
said the sturdy sailor, forgetting for a moment
that he was addressing the sovereign of England.</p>

<p>“So do I,” declared Elizabeth, and she too
forgot that she was a queen, she forgot everything
but the wild adventures that the man before
her had met. Drake went <span class="locked">on:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“We fired across her bow, but she wouldn’t
stop. Then we shot three pieces of ordnance and
struck down her mizzen mast, and we boarded
her. A man could wade up to his waist in the
treasure in her hold. There were thirteen chests
full of Spanish reals, there were six and twenty
tons of silver, and fourscore pounds of gold, and
there were jewels and precious stones. Your
Majesty can see them in the Tower, but oh, how
they glittered and flashed and sparkled in the
dark hold of the vessel when we broke open the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
caskets and turned the light of the lanterns on
them, and how the dons swore at us! It’s many a
month that they should do penance for that day’s
work.”</p>

<p>“I really wonder that you didn’t excommunicate
them as you did your own chaplain,” said
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“They were only swearing, and he was a coward,”
explained Drake. “A man who’ll go about
among the sailors before a fight and tell them
he is not sure that it is the will of God to give
them the victory ought to be excommunicated,
he ought to be hanged.”</p>

<p>“Tell me again just what you said,” demanded
the queen, “that I may see what penalty you deserve
for daring to show dishonor to one of my
chaplains.”</p>

<p>“I chained him by the leg to the forehatch,”
replied Drake, “and I said, ‘Francis Fletcher, I
do here excommunicate thee out of the church of
God, and I renounce thee to the devil and all his
angels;’ and then I tied a riband around his arm,
and I said, ‘If so be that you dare to unbind this
riband, you’ll swing from that yardarm as sure
as my name is Francis Drake.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
“And what was it you wrote on the riband?”
asked the queen, though well knowing the answer.</p>

<p>“I wrote ‘Francis Fletcher, the falsest knave
that liveth.’ I don’t see how I could have done
less.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” agreed Elizabeth heartily,
“and it would but ill become me to differ with a
man who has just given me a New Albion. Where
say you that my new domain lies?”</p>

<p>“On the western shores of North America,”
answered Drake, “and perchance, your Majesty,
this new domain may stretch into Asia itself, for
the western land reaches much farther west than
I had thought, and it may be that in the far north
the New World touches the old.”</p>

<p>“Then I am perhaps queen of the Indies,” said
Elizabeth with a smile. “Now go, my brave
sailor, but see to it that you come soon to court
again, for there is much more that I would know
of this wicked journey of yours.”</p>

<p>So it was that these bold buccaneers went on
their voyages, not so much for adventure or discovery
as for the sake of gold. The easiest way to
get gold was to take it from the Spanish settlements
in America, but when Drake sailed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
Spaniards on the eastern coast of America were
becoming wary. Too many of their treasure ships
had been attacked and too many of their settlements
robbed for them to live as carelessly as
had been the case in the earlier days. Spanish
ships on the Atlantic were manned with men who
could fight, and Spanish settlements on the eastern
coast of America were guarded and fortified.</p>

<p>On the Pacific shore matters were different.
Spanish gold from the fabulously rich mines of
Peru was carried leisurely up the coast in vessels
manned chiefly by negro slaves. At Panama it
was unloaded and taken across the isthmus. Then
it was carefully guarded, and vessels well supplied
with Spanish troops bore it across the ocean
to the treasure vaults of Philip. It did not occur
to the Spaniards that even an English corsair
would venture to round Cape Horn, and when
Drake appeared among the unprotected ships and
the unfortified settlements, he found an easy prey.
It was less dangerous for him to cross the Pacific
and double the Cape of Good Hope than to return
to England among the Spanish vessels on the Atlantic;
and that is why Drake was the first Englishman
to sail around the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
These English buccaneers sailed under a sort of
roving commission from the queen. They were
to give her a share of their profits, but they knew
well that if they could not extricate themselves
from any trouble that they might fall into with
Philip, she would make no effort to defend them,
but would declare that they had had orders to do
no harm to her “good friend, the king of Spain.”
Still, the prizes of success were so enormous and
the charm of adventure so enticing that there was
no lack of bold leaders to rob the coffers of Spain,
to fill the treasury of Elizabeth, and to prepare
experienced seamen for the great struggle that
awaited England when Philip “of the leaden
foot” should at last arise and show his might.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<span class="subhead">THE NEW WORLD</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">To</span> most of the sailors of Elizabeth’s time
the chief inducement to make a voyage to
the westward lay in the possibility of
winning Spanish gold in one way or another, but
a few sailed with quite a different object. A little
more than a century before Drake’s famous voyage
around the world, Columbus had crossed the
Atlantic, hoping to find a shorter passage to India.
In the days of Elizabeth it was well known that a
continent blocked the way to Asia, but mariners
had no idea that North America was nearly as
broad as it has proved to be, and they were ever
hoping to find a passage through it to the wonderful
countries of spices and gems and perfumes.</p>

<p>Interest in the New World was increasing.
Every year new maps, books of travel, and descriptions
of various parts of the earth, especially
of America, were published, some of the descriptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
real and some almost wholly imaginative;
but whatever they were, they always found
readers.</p>

<p>One man who watched eagerly for whatever
came from the press about the New World was a
sea-captain named Martin Frobisher. He read
all these books, he studied globes and charts, and
at last he felt sure that he knew the way to fame
and wealth, but he was a poor man and he could
not carry out his plans alone. He sought an audience
with the queen.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of you before, my gallant captain,”
said Elizabeth graciously. “Didn’t you
care for the building of one of my ships that were
sent against the Irish rebels?”</p>

<p>“I did, your Majesty, and if only that ship belonged
to me, I would put her to a noble use.”</p>

<p>“And what might that be?” asked the queen.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty, men have sailed to the northeast,
to the south, and to the west, but no man has
yet gone to the north of the New World. There
lies the way to India, and to find that way is the
only thing in all the world that is yet left undone
whereby a man may become both rich and notable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
“And so you plan to go to the northwest?”
asked Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“He who has little gold must have few plans,
but it might well be that as the southern land
tapers to a point, so the northern land narrows,
and then with an open sea and a short voyage to
Cathay, what would the wealth of the Spanish
mines be to us? We could buy and sell in every
clime. Give us the riches of India, and we could
fit out a fleet that would drive King Philip from
the shores of the New World, from the waters of
the Atlantic, from&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Perchance from the face of the earth, my
captain?” interrupted Elizabeth. “I promise
you that I will think of this scheme of
yours.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth did think of it, but to her mind there
was a far greater charm in a wild voyage of buccaneering
than in the possibilities of slow gain
by trading with people across two oceans, and
she gave Frobisher no help. He won a friend,
however, in the Earl of Warwick, and the fleet of
three daring little vessels set out for the north.
Elizabeth did not help to pay the costs of the voyage,
but she stood on the shore and waved her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
royal hand to the commander as he dropped slowly
down the Thames.</p>

<p>Frobisher came home with great joy. He
had entered the strait that is called after him, and
he had seen, as he believed, America lying on his
left hand and Asia on his right. That was surely
the way to India. It is no wonder that crowds
went to visit his tiny barque.</p>

<p>“Can you not give me a memento of the voyage?”
asked a lady.</p>

<p>“Next year I will bring you a memento from
China,” answered Frobisher. “Shall it be silks
or jewels or perfumes?”</p>

<p>“Beggars should not be choosers,” said the
lady with a smile, “but give me a bit of this
strange black stone as a pledge that you will not
forget me next year when you are even more
famous than you are to-day.”</p>

<p>“One of the sailors brought that aboard,” said
Frobisher. “It looks like sea-coal, but it is as
heavy as iron.”</p>

<p>This little gift put Frobisher at the head of a
fleet of fifteen vessels, but he was no longer free
to win glory as an explorer. The bit of black
stone was dropped into the fire to see whether it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
would burn, and then vinegar was poured upon it.
It glittered, and an Italian chemist declared that
it was rich in gold. After this there was no difficulty
in raising funds for a voyage to the marvelous
country of the north where gold lay about on
the surface of the ground.</p>

<p>The ships sailed, but they met icebergs, fog,
and storm. Frobisher hesitated. He believed that
he could force his way to the Pacific, but his orders
were to make sure of the gold, and he loaded
his ships with what proved to be only worthless
earth. In later years he won honors and wealth,
but his dream of finding the Northwest Passage
was never realized.</p>

<p>Thus far most people had thought of America
as a place where a man might be fortunate enough
to find a gold mine, but where he was quite as
likely to be killed by the Indians or captured by the
Spaniards. Others looked upon it as a troublesome
mass of land that blocked the way to the
riches of commerce with India. To one young
courtier this strange New World was something
more than the home of possible gold mines, and in
his mind it was certainly not an obstacle to wealth
and success. This young man was named Walter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
Raleigh. He had shown his scholarship at Oxford
and his bravery in a campaign in Ireland. It came
to pass that he and the lord deputy of Ireland disagreed.
“I wish to defend myself before the royal
council,” said Raleigh. This defence was managed
so skilfully that the queen listened with the
closest attention.</p>

<p>“Bring that young Raleigh to me,” she commanded
when the council dissolved.</p>

<p>Raleigh knelt before her and kissed her hand.</p>

<p>“Young man,” said she, “you seem to have
been in no way worsted by those mighty councilors
of mine.”</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” answered Raleigh with the
look of admiration that was so dear to Elizabeth,
“could one fail to be aroused to the best that is
in him when he has the honor of speaking in
the glorious presence of his sovereign?”</p>

<p>“What can you do?” asked the queen bluntly,
but most graciously, for this kind of flattery was
ever a delight to her.</p>

<p>“Shall I bring from Ireland the bodies of those
who have dared to rebel against your Majesty’s
wise and gentle rule?” asked Raleigh, “that they
may testify of me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
“You can fight. Can you do aught beside?”</p>

<p>“Truly, yes, I can count myself the happiest
and most favored of mortals in that upon me is
turned the kindly thought of her who surpasseth
all other women as far as the glowing sun doth
surpass the beams of the farthing rushlight.”</p>

<p>Raleigh was wise enough to keep the favor that
he had won. Elizabeth could rebuke a maid of
honor for wearing too expensive a gown, but of
her courtiers she demanded the most handsome attire
that their purses could provide. This new
favorite had only a shallow purse, but he willingly
spent every penny that he could raise on brilliant
apparel, and he neglected no opportunity to make
himself of use to the queen.</p>

<p>One morning the rain was falling fast, and one
of the ladies in waiting <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Surely your Majesty will remain indoors to-day.”</p>

<p>“My servants may dread the raindrops,” answered
Elizabeth, “but a queen should fear
nothing.”</p>

<p>“With two thousand gowns she may well afford
to spoil one for every shower,” said one lady
to another. This was before the days of umbrellas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
but there was nothing to do save to hope
for sunshine. The hour for the walk came, and
the queen went forth. The sun had come out.</p>

<p>“Someone has been praying for clear skies,”
said she, “and verily I wish he had broadened
his prayer a bit and prayed also for dry ground.”</p>

<p>“It must have been young Raleigh,” said one
of the ladies to another a little pointedly. “He
loves to dwell in the sunshine as the moth loves
the beam of the candle.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t another man in England who can
tell just what to do in any difficulty as well as he,”
declared another lady.</p>

<p>“Then I would that he were here now,” whispered
the first. “The queen will go straight across
that miry place, and if she is ill, we shall have to
bear the blame.”</p>

<p>“There he comes as if he had been sent for
by courier,” said the second, for Raleigh was approaching.
He was decked out in the bravest attire
and was daintily picking his way along the
muddy road.</p>

<p>“It’s but this day week that he had a new
scarlet cloak,” said a lady in the train, “and see
the gorgeousness of the blue plush that he wears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
this morning! I’ll warrant he put his last shilling
into it.”</p>

<p>The queen hesitated a moment, but there was
no hesitation in Raleigh. Quick as thought, he
slipped off the shining blue plush mantle and
spread it on the ground before Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“She who is to her devoted people the glory
of the sunlight must never fail to see under her
feet the reflection of that clear sky which her
shining has bestowed upon her fortunate subjects.”
So said the courtier, and he well knew
that in the glance of approval given him by Elizabeth
lay the promise of many cloaks.</p>

<p>He rose rapidly in the queen’s favor. She gave
him whatever he asked, and he did not hesitate to
ask for what he wanted. Elizabeth had a fashion
of rewarding a favorite by giving him a “monopoly,”
as it was called, that is, the sole right
to sell some one thing. One man had the right
to sell gunpowder, another salt, while yet another
was the only man in England who was allowed
to collect and export old shoes. To Raleigh she
gave the privilege of exporting woolen cloth, and
at another time the sole right to sell wine in the
kingdom. He was no longer a poor young courtier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
straining every resource to dress as handsomely
as the taste of the queen demanded. Now
he wore silver armor that sparkled with rubies
and pearls and diamonds. Even his shoes were so
encrusted with jewels that they were said to be
worth more than six thousand gold pieces. Money
flowed freely into his coffers. Besides Elizabeth’s
other gifts, he could ask for his monopolies whatever
price he chose, and whoever wished to buy
must pay it. There were rumors that this brilliant
young favorite had higher aspirations, even
to the hand of the queen herself. The story is
told that one day when Raleigh was standing by
a window, tracing idly scrolls and letters on the
pane with a diamond, he heard the queen coming
up softly behind him. He went on as if he did
not know of her presence and wrote on the
<span class="locked">glass:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Fain would I climb, but that I fear to fall.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Elizabeth drew a diamond ring from her finger
and put an ending to the <span class="locked">couplet:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“If thy heart fail thee, do not climb at all.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
With such encouragement, it is no wonder that
Raleigh felt sure of her interest in whatever he
wished to attempt. He had a great undertaking
in mind, and between his compliments to Elizabeth
his thoughts often turned to the westward, to
the wonderful New World. It was not hard to
persuade the queen to give him a grant of land
in America, and he sent out two barques to explore
the coast north of Florida. When the
skippers returned, Raleigh brought them before
the queen.</p>

<p>“Is this new country so much better than our
own old England?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing could be better than the land which
has the happiness to be ruled directly by your
Majesty,” answered Raleigh, “but, truly, the
New World is a goodly place.”</p>

<p>“How does it differ from our land?” asked the
queen of one of the skippers, and he <span class="locked">answered:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Your Majesty, as we drew near the shore,
there was no smell of wharfs or fishing, but a
fragrance as if we were in the midst of some
delicate garden.”</p>

<p>“We have perfumes in England,” said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
queen. “Did you discover anything better than
pleasant odors?” she asked of the second skipper.</p>

<p>“Yes, your Majesty, we found what is not in
all England, for when we landed, the low, sandy
shore was so overgrown with grapes that the very
beating and surge of the sea overflowed them;
the vines ran over hills and plains, they climbed
every little shrub, and they made their way to the
tops of the cedars. I do think that in all the
world the like abundance is not to be found.”</p>

<p>“Perfumes and grapes,” said the queen. “Raleigh,
my man, that is a good beginning. Send
your skippers away, and tell me what is your request,
for I know you have one. When will you
ever cease begging, Walter?”</p>

<p>“When you cease to be so kind a benefactress,”
was the courtier’s shrewd and graceful reply.</p>

<p>The skippers were sent away, and the queen
<span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Now tell me about this land of grapes. Fruit
and perfumes are well enough, but they do little
to fill an empty treasury. What else lies within
your patent?”</p>

<p>“There are beasts of all kinds that roam the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
forests, there are birds and fish, there are the
highest and reddest cedars of the world, coral of
red and white, pearls, fruits, vegetables, natives
that are gentle and kindly and void of all guile
and treason.”</p>

<p>“What do you call this paradise of yours?”</p>

<p>“The natives call it Wingina.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you a better name. It was visited
while a virgin queen was on the throne, so call it
Virginia, and I’ll be its godmother.”</p>

<p>“O, Madam,” said Raleigh with enthusiasm,
“never had a sovereign such a chance to add to
the glory of her renown. America is not only
a country in which one may make a fortune, it
is a fortune in itself. Why should it not become
a second home of the English nation?”</p>

<p>The queen’s eyes kindled. “How could that
be?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” he answered, eagerly, “the
soil of Virginia is the richest in the world. The
natives sow their corn in May and they reap it
in July; they sow it again in June and July, and
they reap it but two months after the planting.
Our men put peas into the ground, and in ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
days they were fourteen inches high. Beans and
wheat and oats may be had for the asking.”</p>

<p>“And supposing my good friend Philip should
fall upon these amazingly fertile lands, he might
put the colonists to the sword even before their
peas were above the ground.”</p>

<p>“Might we not also fancy a strong band of
colonists building vessels of the goodly trees of
the Virginia forests and sailing out boldly into
the Atlantic to capture the treasure ships of Spain?
Might not the colonists steer to the northward and
free our Newfoundland fishing grounds from the
hateful presence of the Spaniard?”</p>

<p>“‘Walter, thou reasonest well,’” laughed the
queen, “but one little thing you’ve mayhap forgot.
Tell me, Walter, my man, where shall we
find these worthy colonists who are to raise corn
in two months and fight King Philip while it is
growing?”</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” answered the courtier
gravely, “those who are driven from England
will be our colonists.”</p>

<p>“Driven from England,” repeated the queen,
“what mean you by that?”</p>

<p>“Our farmers have long been raising sheep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
instead of grain,” said he. “One man can easily
care for many sheep. Those men that are driven
from their old farm work can find naught else to
do. They must starve or steal, and, Madam, it
grieves me sorely to see that twenty or even thirty
are often hanged before the hour of noon for
stealing a shilling or perchance but a morsel of
bread.”</p>

<p>“They who steal must be punished,” said the
queen, “but it would please me well if there were
some other remedy than hanging.”</p>

<p>“The corn of Virginia will be a remedy, my
queen, and there is yet another benefit that would
come to England from colonies across the Atlantic.
We wish to spread our commerce to foreign
lands, but if we have a second England on the
other side of the sea, will not our own countrymen
of America buy and sell with us? Cannot laws
be made that they shall trade with no others, if,
indeed, they should be so disloyal as to think of
such a thing? Why need we care for trade with a
nation across the Pacific when we can trade with
our own people in Virginia?”</p>

<p>“Walter, you are wonderfully in earnest about
this scheme of yours. It would ill become me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
question the fairness or worthiness of my godchild,
and I will think of what you say, I will
think of it.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth thought of the plan, indeed the air
was so full of talk about the proposed Virginian
colony that she could have hardly helped thinking
about it. In Virginia there was fertile soil, a
good hope of finding gems and gold, and little
probability of trouble with the Indians. Her
councilors discussed the plan. Said one to <span class="locked">another:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Think you that the queen will aid young
Raleigh?”</p>

<p>“‘Sir Walter’ you must say now that he has
become a knight,” rejoined the second. “Yes,
I do believe that she will. Has she not followed
his every whim till Leicester has fairly turned
green with jealousy? She has just given him the
wine monopoly, and that is worth thousands of
pounds in a single year. If she gives him that,
would she withhold aid for the bringing up of this
‘godchild’ of hers?”</p>

<p>“You’re a shrewd man, I admit,” said the first,
“but I’ve watched this queen of ours since she
was no higher than my table, and I’ve never yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
seen her affection for any one get the better of her.
She’s a woman, but she’s also a queen, and she’s
more queen than woman.”</p>

<p>“I’m not the man to hold an opinion and fear
to back it up,” rejoined the other. “I’ve a fair
bit of land down in Devon, and I’ll wager it
against that house of yours in London that she’ll
help ‘educate the godchild.’”</p>

<p>The land was lost, for Elizabeth could not bear
to part with her gold pieces unless she could be
sure of a generous return. Raleigh did not give
up his plan, however, and soon a company of
colonists was sent to Roanoke Island, off the coast
of what is now North Carolina. The colony
failed because the new settlers were too eager to
search for gold to spend their time planting corn
and beans, or even peas that would grow fourteen
inches in ten days. “They are lazy and homesick,
and they talk too much,” reported the governor,
and when a fleet of Drake’s came to shore, they
all went aboard and sailed for home.</p>

<p>These homesick colonists carried tobacco with
them to England, and smoking soon became the
fashionable amusement. Sir Walter was enthusiastic
in its praise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
“One would think that this wonderful plant
of yours was your own child,” said the queen to
him as he sat puffing out the smoke from his silver
pipe, “you claim for it so many virtues.”</p>

<p>“You say well, Madam,” declared Sir Walter.
“It is verily a wonderful plant.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose you would even say that you
could tell the weight of that smoke of yours.
There’s no boundary to your impudence.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I can, your Majesty,” returned Sir
Walter calmly.</p>

<p>“I’ll wager this pin against your buckle that
you cannot,” retorted the queen.</p>

<p>“I’ll take the wager,” said he, “and with the
more joy since the experiment will secure me the
delight of your presence.” He weighed some
tobacco and put it into his pipe. Then after he
had smoked it he weighed the ashes. “The difference
is the weight of the smoke,” said he, and
Elizabeth paid the bet. “Many a man have I
known who has turned his gold into smoke,” she
declared merrily, “but you are surely the first
who has turned his smoke into gold. You’re a
marvelous man, Sir Walter.”</p>

<span class="subhead">THE QUEEN OF SCOTS</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> councilor’s words that Elizabeth was
more queen than woman were shown to
be true whenever matters came to the
proof. She gave her favorite Leicester everything
that he asked save her own royal hand, but on
occasion she could be as severe with Leicester as
if he had been her enemy.</p>

<p>It was the custom for the general of an English
army to serve without salary and to contribute
generously to his own expenses and those of his
troops. The general, then, must be a rich man,
and in order to have the most perfect control over
his soldiers he must be a man who was known
to be in the confidence of the queen. No one was
better qualified in these important respects to
lead an army than Leicester, and he was put at the
head of the forces that were sent to the aid of the
Dutch states then revolting against Philip. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
leader had been assassinated, and they asked to
be annexed to England. Elizabeth saw clearly
that to grant their request would bring on war
with Spain at once, and she refused. When
Leicester was appointed commander, she gave him
the most positive orders to accept no such position
for her as ruler of the Low Countries. News
soon came that Leicester had been made governor
general.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” said her informer, “it is said
that Lord Leicester is shown great honor in the
Low Countries.”</p>

<p>“That is well,” said the queen. “The commander
of an army should ever be treated with
deference.”</p>

<p>“The Dutch states prove by the respect given
to Lord Leicester what honor they would show to
your Majesty if you were with them.”</p>

<div id="i246" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/p246.jpg" width="600" height="436" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Mary Stuart receiving her death sentence.&mdash;<i>From painting
by Carl Piloty</i>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“In what fashion do they show their respect?”
asked the queen so gently that Leicester’s enemy
took courage and ventured to go a step further.</p>

<p>“He is called governor-general, and they say
that men kneel before him to kiss his hand, and
that he has already a court as brilliant as that of
England.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
“Is that true?” asked Elizabeth with a feigned
indifference. “Do you know more of this court
of his?”</p>

<p>“Little now, but there will be more and greater
news, for it is said that Lady Leicester is about
to go to Holland and that with her will go such
a train of ladies and gentlemen and such rich
coaches, litters, and sidesaddles, that your Majesty
has none such in England.”</p>

<p>Then Elizabeth’s wrath broke forth. “I will
let the upstart know,” said she, “how easily the
hand that has exalted him can beat him down.”
She wrote an angry letter to her absent favorite
which <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I have raised you from the dust and shown
you favor above all others, and I should never
have imagined you would dare to break
my express commandment to accept any such
title.”</p>

<p>It was a hard position for Burleigh, since he
himself and the rest of the council had wished
Leicester to accept the title and so force the queen
to become sovereign of the Dutch states, whether
she would or not. The queen’s rage was visited
upon even her old friend and adviser, and to Burleigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
himself she declared, “You are nothing but
a presumptuous fellow.”</p>

<p>The great test of Elizabeth’s character was
soon to come, for the year 1587 was at hand.
Would she be woman or queen? A stern question
must be decided. Jesting with Raleigh, exasperating
King Philip, storming at Leicester and
then forgiving him, amusing herself with Leicester’s
handsome stepson, the Earl of Essex, bedecking
herself in gorgeous attire that flashed
with jewels and gold, dreaming over new routes
to India and new English nations in Virginia&mdash;all
these had to be put away for the time. What
should be the fate of the Queen of Scots could
no longer be left undecided.</p>

<p>Mary had been a captive in England for nearly
eighteen years, and those years had been almost as
full of peril to Elizabeth as to her prisoner. If
Mary was dead, the Catholics who were plotting
against Elizabeth would have no object in trying
to take her life, for Mary’s son James was the
next heir to the throne, and he was as strong a
Protestant as Elizabeth. On the other hand, if
Elizabeth were no longer alive, Mary would become
queen of England, and Protestants would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
be obliged to be loyal to her as their lawful sovereign.
They would be the more content knowing
that her Protestant son would succeed her. Thus,
if either Mary or Elizabeth were dead, England
would be free from the plots and conspiracies that
had been revealed, one after another, during the
captivity of Mary.</p>

<p>At the discovery of each of these plots, Mary’s
imprisonment became more rigorous. It was
claimed that she was at the bottom of every conspiracy.</p>

<p>“The Queen of Scots and her friends will yet
have my life,” said Elizabeth, and she added jestingly
to her councilors, “I’ll come back after I
am dead and see her make your heads fly.”</p>

<p>Walsingham, one of Elizabeth’s ministers, had
been most watchful of these plots. His spies were
ever on the lookout, and in the summer of 1586
he found sure proof of a conspiracy to take the
life of the queen. Was Mary connected with this
plot? Sworn testimony declared that she was.
Her papers were seized, and among them were
found letters from many leading nobles of England
expressing sympathy in her troubles. Mary
was at once removed to Fotheringay Castle, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
she was much more closely guarded than ever before.
Thirty-six commissioners were appointed
to try her on the charge of plotting against the
life of the English queen. She was cited to appear
before them.</p>

<p>“That will I never do,” she declared. “I have
a right to be tried by my peers. I am a queen, and
only sovereigns are my peers, but I will defend
myself before the queen of England and her council
or even before the English Parliament.”</p>

<p>Then a letter was given her from Elizabeth
which <span class="locked">read;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“You have attempted to take my life and to
bring my kingdom to destruction by bloodshed. I
have never proceeded so harshly against you, but
have protected and maintained you like myself.
It is my will that you answer the nobles and peers
of the kingdom as if I were myself present. Act
plainly, without reserve, and you will sooner be
able to obtain favor from me.”</p>

<p>“Is it wise to make these refusals?” asked
one of her friends. “You are in the power of the
English queen, is it not better to rouse her no
further by hopeless demands?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
“True, it is hopeless,” answered Mary, “it is
all hopeless. I am a sovereign kept here unlawfully
as a prisoner by the royal cousin to whom I
fled for help in my trouble. Her laws have not
protected me, why then must I be sentenced under
them?”</p>

<p>“The court is convened,” said the commissioners,
“and if you refuse to appear, you will be at
once declared guilty without a trial. Queen
Elizabeth has said many times that nothing would
please her so much as to have proof of your innocence.
Is it wise to refuse to give proof?”</p>

<p>Finally Mary yielded. Her trial would not be
legal to-day, for she was allowed no counsel, she
was not even permitted to see her own papers or to
hear and question those persons who testified
against her, but it was according to the laws of
the time, and she was tried with no greater severity
than was shown to all prisoners accused of
treason.</p>

<p>“Your letters prove that you have allowed your
correspondents to address you as queen of England,”
declared the crown lawyers, “that you
have tried to induce King Philip to invade our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
country, and that you have been knowing to the
late plot to assassinate the lawful queen of the
realm.”</p>

<p>“With the plot against the life of my cousin
Elizabeth I had nothing to do,” declared Mary.
“That I have sought to gain my freedom by the
aid of my friends I do not deny. My lords, I am
unjustly and cruelly deprived of my liberty. Do
you blame me for trying by every means in my
power to recover it? Could anyone do otherwise?”</p>

<p>So the charges and the denials went on, and
when the trial was over, the judges left Fotheringay
Castle. Again they met, and everyone
voted that Mary was guilty of high treason in plotting
against the life of the English queen. She
was sentenced to death. This was the report made
to Parliament, and that body solemnly agreed to
the verdict. It was proclaimed in London, and
the whole city gave itself up to rejoicing. Bells
were rung, bonfires blazed in every square, shouts
of joy and psalms of thanksgiving resounded
throughout the town.</p>

<p>“Think you that the queen will ever carry out
the sentence?” asked one Londoner of another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
“It is many years,” was the reply, “that the
hand of Elizabeth alone has saved the life of the
Scotch queen. Parliament decreed her death fifteen
years ago and they say that Elizabeth was
the angriest woman in England. ‘Would you
have me put to death the bird that, to
escape the hawk, has fled to me for protection?
I’ll never sign such a bill,’ and she
never did.”</p>

<p>“The constant dropping of water will wear
away stone,” said the first, “and yet I hear that
she has sent a message to Parliament commanding
them to find some other way.”</p>

<p>“Until the axe falls, nothing will persuade me
that the child of Henry VIII. will consent to
see the blood of one of her own proud race flow
at the hand of the executioner,” declared the second,
“and what is more, she will not do a deed
that will arouse the scorn and hatred of Europe.
Mary’s head is safe.”</p>

<p>“Not so fast, my friend. Who are the supporters
of Mary? Who is the ‘Europe’ whose
scorn will check the pen of Elizabeth when she is
about to sign the death warrant?”</p>

<p>“Philip, the Pope, the king of France, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
Mary’s own son James. They are a powerful
company.”</p>

<p>“Are they? Philip is really almost at war
with us now, but it is not in Mary’s interest.
The Pope cares nothing about putting a Catholic
woman of forty-four on the throne when in a few
years she will be succeeded by a Protestant son.
The king of France can do nothing for her but
plead, for if he strikes one blow at England, it
is a blow in favor of Spain.”</p>

<p>“Her own son&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Has made a treaty with Elizabeth. He will
do anything to make sure of the English throne,
and indeed, can he be blamed for lack of affection
when he knows that his mother planned to
leave her claim not to him but to Philip?”</p>

<p>Elizabeth was most unwilling that Mary should
be put to death. Her ministers were eager for
the execution, for it was their business to
secure the peace of England and the welfare of
their queen. They believed that only Mary’s
death would bring this about. Then, too, as
Elizabeth had said jestingly, if Mary were once
on the throne, she would “make their heads fly.”
Surely they had a right to care for their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
safety, they reasoned. Elizabeth could not bear
the thought that a princess of the Tudor blood
should die on the scaffold. She was always careless
of her personal danger, and she knew that
the death of Mary would be ascribed to her own
fear or jealousy. It is no wonder that she hesitated.</p>

<p>“What shall we do,” queried the ministers.
“Elizabeth must be induced to sign the death
warrant, of course, but who will order it carried
out?”</p>

<p>“The queen will never do such a thing,” said
one.</p>

<p>“We must do it ourselves,” said another.
“There are ten of us, and ten cannot well be
made to suffer for carrying out a written order
of the queen’s.”</p>

<p>For many weeks Elizabeth hesitated. She
often sat buried in deep thought. “Shall I bear
with her or smite her?” the ladies of the bedchamber
heard her say to herself. At last she
bade the secretary Davison bring her the warrant.</p>

<p>“What have you in your hand?” she asked
as he entered the room.</p>

<p>“Sundry papers that await your Majesty’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
signature,” answered Davison. Elizabeth took up
her pen and signed the warrant. Then she pushed
it away from her and it fell upon the floor.</p>

<p>“Are you not heartily sorry to see this done?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“I should be far from rejoicing in any one’s
calamity,” replied Davison, “but the life of the
Queen of Scots is so great a threat to the life of
your Majesty that not to sign the paper would
be a wrong to your whole realm as much as to
yourself.”</p>

<p>“I have done all that either law or reason
could require of me,” said the queen, “and now
let me hear nothing further.”</p>

<p>Davison reported the scene to the council.</p>

<p>“She means the deed to be done,” said one,
“but she has given no orders to carry out the
warrant.”</p>

<p>“That is her way of dealing with her sea-captains,”
said another. “Does she not provide
them with ships and guns and soldiers, and does
she not most willingly take a share of Spanish
gold? But if a commander gets into trouble with
Spain, she will say, ‘Did I not give orders to do
no harm to my good friend Philip?’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
“Then must all ten of us give the final order,”
said another. This was done. The warrant and
the letter commanding the execution were sent.</p>

<p>About a week after the signing of the warrant,
bonfires blazed and bells rang.</p>

<p>“The bells ring as merrily as if there were
some good news,” said the queen. “Why is it?”</p>

<p>“It is because of the death of the Queen of
Scots,” was the answer. Elizabeth said not a
word. A day or two later she was told that
Mary had been executed at Fotheringay Castle.
She turned pale, she burst into tears, she stormed
at her councilors. “Never shall your crime be
pardoned,” she raged. “You well knew that I
did not mean my kinswoman to be put to death.
You have dared to usurp my authority, and you
are worse traitors than my poor cousin. As for
you, Burleigh, do you never dare show yourself
in my presence again. I have made you and I
can unmake you. That fellow Davison knew
that I did not mean the warrant to be carried
out. Take him to the Tower.”</p>

<p>“He is very ill, your Majesty,” said one.</p>

<p>“Then take his illness with him, for into the
Tower he goes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
“Your Majesty,” pleaded the councilors, “if
your secretary Davison is imprisoned, the lords
of your council will be regarded as plotters and
murderers.”</p>

<p>“What is that to me?” cried Elizabeth.
“They who murder must expect to be called murderers.”</p>

<p>Davison was imprisoned for some time and
was fined so heavily that he was reduced to
poverty. Elizabeth sent a copy of his sentence
to King James and also a letter telling him that
the execution of his mother was a “miserable
accident.” James was easily comforted. He had
been taught to look upon her as a shame and disgrace
to himself. If she had not been the murderer
of his father, she had, at least, married the
murderer, and within three months after the
commission of the crime. He was lawful heir
to the throne of England, but he knew that she
had done all that lay in her power to deprive
him of his birthright. He wrote an earnest letter
to Elizabeth in the attempt to save his mother’s
life, but it was soon followed by a sort of apology
and an intimation that all would be well if she
would formally recognize him as her successor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
It is probable that there will always be two
opinions in regard to the justice of Mary’s execution.</p>

<p>“She fled to England for refuge,” says one,
“and should have been set free.”</p>

<p>“To set her free would have been to deliver
her up to the foes who would have taken her
life,” says the other, “or else to the friends who
would have made war against England.”</p>

<p>“A prisoner cannot be blamed for seeking
liberty.”</p>

<p>“But one may be justly punished for plotting
treason.”</p>

<p>“Mary was not a subject of the queen of England.”</p>

<p>“He who commits treason is punished whether
he is a subject or not.”</p>

<p>“The testimony against her was false.”</p>

<p>“It was sworn to by solemn oath. There was
no other means of discovering the truth.”</p>

<p>As to Elizabeth’s real share in the execution
of Mary there is quite as much difference of
opinion.</p>

<p>“Because of her fear and jealousy she put to
death the cousin to whom she had given every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
reason to expect protection,” say the partisans
of Mary.</p>

<p>“It shows little of either fear or jealousy to
let her live for fifteen years,” retort the supporters
of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“At least she signed the warrant with her own
hand.”</p>

<p>“Even a Tudor queen was not free to follow
her own will. The English council had urged
the deed for many years.”</p>

<p>“Secretary Davison declared that she wished
the warrant carried out.”</p>

<p>“Davison told four different stories, and no
one of them agreed with Elizabeth’s version of
the scene. Who shall tell where truth lies?”</p>

<p>“The warrant would have been worthless
without her name.”</p>

<p>“Walsingham’s private secretary confessed
many years afterwards that he forged the name
at his master’s command.”</p>

<div id="i260" class="figcenter" style="width: 432px;">
<img src="images/p260.jpg" width="432" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Last moment of Mary, Queen of Scots.&mdash;<i>From painting
by an unknown artist.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>“Then why did she not deny the signature?”</p>

<p>“To whom? To James she did deny it as far
as she dared. She wrote him that the execution
was a ‘miserable accident.’ To her council she
made no denial because the forger was the tool of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
the council, and had but carried out their will.
Elizabeth could storm at her councilors, but,
Tudor as she was, she had not the power to
oppose their united determination.” So the discussion
has gone on for three hundred years.</p>

<p>The surest way for a wrongdoer to have his
crimes forgotten and forgiven is to meet with
dignity and resignation the death that his deeds
have made his lawful punishment. Whether
Mary deserved this penalty or not, her calmness
on the scaffold and her gentle submission to the
death from which there was no escape have won
friends and admirers for her even among the
sternest critics of her life and her acts.</p>

<p>When the time was come for her execution,
she went quietly to the hall of Fotheringay Castle,
supported by two attendants, while a third bore
her train. With a calm and cheerful face she
stepped upon the low platform where lay the
block. Platform, railing, block, and a low stool
were heavily draped with black. She seated herself
on the stool. On her right sat the two nobles
to whom the charge of her execution had been
committed, on her left stood the sheriff, and in
front of her the two executioners, while around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
the railing stood many knights and other gentlemen
who had come to see her die. Her robes
belonged to the executioners, and when they began
to remove her gown, as the custom was, she
smiled and said she had never before been disrobed
by such grooms. She had begged that some
of her women might be with her to the last, and
when they could no longer control themselves but
began to weep and lament, she kissed them and
said gently, “Do not weep, my friends, I have
promised that you will not. Rejoice, for you
will soon see an end of all your mistress’s troubles.”
She repeated a Latin prayer, and then an
English prayer for the church, for her son James,
and for Queen Elizabeth, “that she might prosper
and serve God aright.” Her women pinned a
linen cloth over her face. She knelt down upon
the cushion and laid her head upon the block.
“Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit,”
she cried, and so died Mary Stuart, Queen of
Scotland and heir to the throne of England.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE SPANISH ARMADA</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">An</span> Englishman living in Lisbon hastened
home to England and demanded audience
with the queen.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” said he, “King Philip is
making great preparations for some warlike enterprise.
In the Lisbon harbor are twenty galleons
and forty other vessels. Men from Italy
and Germany are coming in by hundreds. What
can this mean but an attack upon England?”</p>

<p>Two months later came a message to the queen
from her spies in <span class="locked">Spain:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Soldiers are coming every day, and vast
quantities of wine, grain, biscuit, bacon, oil,
vinegar, barley meal, and salted meats are being
laid in besides powder and cannon.” A ship that
had recently sailed from Lisbon was captured,
and both captain and men were tortured on the
rack that more might be learned of the doings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
of Philip. All told the same story, that he was
planning an invasion of England.</p>

<p>In those days honor between sovereigns was
a thing almost unknown. No one blamed the
government of one country for trying to get the
better of that of another. While Philip was
making ready for war, he and Elizabeth were
engaged in arranging for a treaty of peace and
friendship. Each knew that the other was treacherous,
but each meant to get the better of the
bargain.</p>

<p>On the arrival of this news from Spain, Elizabeth
sent for Drake. “Sir Francis,” said she,
“how would it please you to make a voyage to
Spain?”</p>

<p>Drake guessed in a moment what she wished
of him and answered most <span class="locked">heartily:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“There’s nothing in all the world that would
do me greater good.”</p>

<p>“Ships and stores and soldiers are assembling
off Cadiz and Lisbon. It would be a goodly
sight, perhaps as fine as anything you saw in your
voyage around the world.”</p>

<p>“With how many ships may I go?” asked
Drake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
“I can give you four, and the merchants will
add to the fleet.”</p>

<p>They did add twenty-six vessels of all kinds
and sizes, for they well knew that, though Drake
would probably sail with the usual orders to “do
no harm to my good friend, the king of Spain,”
the chances were that every vessel would come
back with a valuable cargo.</p>

<p>Drake made a rapid voyage, and on his return
he at once brought his report to the queen.</p>

<p>“Well, my sailor lad,” was her greeting,
“have you another wild tale of adventure to tell
me? Have you made me queen of a new land or
have you excommunicated your chaplain?”</p>

<p>“I’ve not excommunicated my chaplain,” returned
Drake, “but it’ll take many a blessing
from the Pope to make up to the Spaniards for
that merry time off Cadiz. I’ve not discovered a
new country, but your Majesty is queen of what
is stowed away in my ships, and perchance that
is of more worth than some of the raw lands that
lie to the westward.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth’s eyes shone. “I know you’ve been
in many a gallant fight,” said she, “and now tell
me just what you have done.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
“The Spanish fleet was off Cadiz ready to sail
for Lisbon, so there was nothing else to do but
to attack it. We took eighty or more of their
vessels, laden with stores to the gunwale, and we
captured two galleons.”</p>

<p>“So that’s the way you do no harm to my
friend Philip,” said the queen. “Brave sailor
laddie that you are, what did you do next?”</p>

<p>“My men were a bit weary of the sea,” answered
Drake, “and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, it must have been a dull and wearisome
voyage,” said Elizabeth with a smile. “And
what did you do to amuse them?”</p>

<p>“There was little to do, but we took three
castles and burned some fishing boats and nets.
I hadn’t time for much, for there was news of a
carrack coming from India, and it was only
courtesy to sail out and give her a greeting.”</p>

<p>“Surely,” said the queen. “My sailors are
always ready to show that kind of courtesy to an
enemy in loneliness on the ocean.”</p>

<p>“That’s the whole story,” said Drake, “save
that the carrack was full of the richest treasure
that ever sailed the seas, and I brought it home.”</p>

<p>“That is more of your courtesy,” said Elizabeth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
“You would save the busy king from the
care of it, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Yes, your Majesty. He’ll be busy enough
for one while. We’ve singed his whiskers for
him.”</p>

<p>The stories were true. Philip was at last determined
to attack England. Mary was dead,
and he claimed the crown by virtue of his connection
with the royal house of Lancaster and by
the will of the Queen of Scots. There was another
side to his plan, Elizabeth had torn her
country from its allegiance to the Pope, and this
invasion was a crusade. If he conquered England,
the country would be brought back to the
Roman church, and so would Holland; it was a
holy war. A Spanish cardinal wrote, “Spain
does not war against Englishmen, but against
Elizabeth. It is not England but her wretched
queen who has overthrown the Holy Church and
persecuted the pious Catholics. Let the English
people rise and welcome their deliverer.” This
letter was circulated throughout England, but
it produced no effect save to increase the loyalty
of the English Catholics. They were the more
indignant because the author of the letter was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
an Englishman who had abandoned his country
and become a subject of Spain. “It is only the
blast of a beggarly traitor,” declared Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The “singeing of his whiskers” kept Philip
waiting for a year. To sail out into the Atlantic
with the probability of meeting the autumn gales
far away from any friendly harbor would have
been a reckless thing to do, and it was not easy to
bring together at short notice stores enough to
take the place of those that had been destroyed.
Philip waited. He even gave the queen a final
chance to avoid the attack, for he sent her a Latin
verse to the effect that she might even yet escape
his conquest by agreeing to return the treasure
taken by Drake, to render no more aid to the
Low Countries, and to bring her kingdom back to
the Church of Rome. Elizabeth replied, “My
good king, I’ll obey you when the Greek kalends
come around,” and as the Greeks had no kalends,
there was little hope of peace.</p>

<p>While the shipbuilders of Spain were working
night and day, and while men and provisions and
powder and cannon were being brought together,
England, too, was preparing for the encounter.
There was no ally on the continent to lend aid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
the King of Scots might be faithful and he might
not, according to what he regarded as for his
interests. The fortifications of the kingdom were
weak. At Portsmouth the guns could not be fired
when the queen was crowned because the tower
was so old and ready to crumble, and for thirty
years little had been done to put it in order.
This very weakness, however, of the resources
of the government was England’s strength, for
every Englishman saw that if his country was
to be saved from becoming a province of Spain,
he and every other man must do his best to defend
it. The council sent a message to <span class="locked">London:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“What number of ships and men is it your
wish to contribute to the defence of the land?”</p>

<p>“How many may properly be required of us?”
asked the Londoners.</p>

<p>“Fifteen ships and five thousand men,” was
the answer.</p>

<p>Now in all London there were hardly more
than seventeen thousand men, but the city
straightway wrote to the <span class="locked">council:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Ten thousand men and thirty ships we will
gladly provide, and the ships shall be amply furnished.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
So it was throughout the kingdom. Every
town sent a generous number of men and generous
gifts of money. Every little village on the
coast hastened to refit its fishing vessels and
offer boats and sailors to the government. The
wildest stories were rife of what the Spaniards
would do if they were once in control of the
country. It was said that they had already lists
of the stately castles of the realm and the homes
of rich London merchants, marked with the names
of the Spanish nobles to whom they were to be
given. Most of the English were to be hanged,
so the rumor went, but all children under seven
years of age were to be branded on the face and
kept as slaves.</p>

<p>Philip had not expected to conquer England
without other aid than that of the soldiers whom
he was to carry with him. He had a large band
of allies, on English soil, so he thought, waiting
for his coming and ready to welcome him. These
were the Catholics of England. The Pope had
excommunicated Elizabeth and had pronounced
the curse of the church upon all Catholics that
should support her.</p>

<p>“These are not common days,” said one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
her advisers, “and in such times there must often
be resort to means that would be most cruel and
unjust in other years.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” demanded the queen.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty has of course not failed to
consider the support that the Spanish king may
find if he succeeds in landing upon our shores.”</p>

<p>“Who will support him, you or I?”</p>

<p>“It would be but natural for those of his own
church to welcome him.”</p>

<p>“They’ll welcome him with powder and
cannon.”</p>

<p>“Your Majesty, when your illustrious father,
King Henry VIII., was about to depart for the
French wars, did he not bring to the block his
own cousin and others who were most devoted to
the old faith, lest they should raise an insurrection
while he was on the continent?”</p>

<p>“And you would cut off the heads of my
faithful subjects? They shall attend my church,
and if they will not, they shall be fined or imprisoned.
My agents are zealous, and it may be
that they have sometimes gone beyond my orders,
but I tell you that I rule men and women, not
their thoughts, and if a man obeys me, his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
stays on his shoulders, mark that. I’ll tell you
one thing more, the lord high-admiral of my fleet
is to be Howard of Effingham. What think you
of that, my man?”</p>

<p>“But, your Majesty, he is a strong supporter
of the old faith.”</p>

<p>“So will he be of the new queen,” replied
Elizabeth calmly.</p>

<p>Howard became admiral, and Drake vice-admiral,
while Frobisher and Hawkins served as
captains and Raleigh sailed out in his own vessel
as a volunteer. Howard knew almost nothing
of naval command, but around him were officers
of experience, and he was not so exalted by his
new dignity that he scorned to learn of them.
The sailors watched him closely, and when they
saw him put his own hands to the towing rope,
they shouted “Hurrah for the admiral!”
Nobles and commoners were mingled, and not
one among them seemed to have any thought of
rank or dignity. It was for England that they
were working, and the honor lay in helping to
save the country.</p>

<p>The English vessels came together. There
were all sorts of craft, ranging from a ship not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
much smaller than the galleons of the Spaniards
to what were hardly more than mere fishing boats.
They were miserably supplied with food and
powder, for it was very hard for Elizabeth to
make up her mind to meet the vast expenses of
war. Almost every letter of the admiral’s contained
a request for absolute necessities that were
given out most grudgingly. Beef was too dear,
thought the queen, and she changed the sailors’
rations to a scanty supply of fish, oil, and peas.
The wages were in arrears, there was not powder
enough, food was carried to the ships in small
quantities, though Howard declared indignantly,
“King Harry never made a less supply than six
weeks.” At the least rumor that the Spaniards
were not coming, Elizabeth would give orders to
reduce the English fleet. The Invincible Armada
had left Spain, and Howard wrote, “Beseech
Burleigh to hasten provisions. If the wind holds
out for six days, Spain will be knocking at our
doors.”</p>

<p>One evening in July a game of bowls was
going on at the Pelican Inn in Plymouth.</p>

<p>“Your turn, Frobisher,” said Hawkins, “and
then Sir Walter’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
“That’s well done, Sir Walter. Yours next,
Sir Francis,” said Howard. Drake stooped for
the ball, and was about to send it, when an old
sailor rushed into the room and <span class="locked">cried:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Admiral, Admiral, they’re coming! I saw
them off the Lizard, and there are hundreds of
them.”</p>

<p>“What do you say, Admiral,” asked Drake
with his hand still on the ball, “Won’t there
be time to finish the game and then go out and
give the dons a thrashing?”</p>

<div id="i274" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><p>The Spanish Armada attacked by the English Fleet.</p>

</div>

<p>The Spanish ships slowly made their way into
the Channel. They were so large and so high
at stem and stern that they looked like great floating
castles, but they were so clumsy and difficult
to manage that the nimble little English boats
had a great advantage. The Spanish fleet formed
in a wide crescent, the two points seven miles
apart, and the English boats went out to meet
them. The galleons were high and the English
vessels so low that it was difficult to train the
Spanish guns upon them, moreover, the Spaniards
were not good marksmen. They would have had
a better chance, however, if the English had only
been willing to stand still and be fired at, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
Spanish were much surprised and disgusted when
the saucy little English craft slipped up under
their very bows, fired a shot or two and were
away firing at the next ship before the Spanish
guns could be trained upon them. Some of the
little boats sailed the whole length of the crescent,
firing at every vessel and coming off without a
scar.</p>

<p>This kind of encounter was kept up for more
than a week, for the English hesitated to attempt
a regular engagement. The Spanish suffered
severely. Masts were shattered, the rigging was
cut up, great, ragged holes were torn in the hulls,
and large numbers of sailors were slain, but even
worse was to follow.</p>

<p>The Spaniards were anchored off Calais. At
two o’clock one morning a strange, shapeless object
was seen floating toward them. Then came
another and another until there were eight. Fire
blazed up from the floating monsters. There
were explosions and suffocating gases. The
flames rose higher, wind and waves were bringing
these malignant creatures, that seemed half
alive, into the midst of the Spanish fleet.</p>

<p>This attack by fire-boats was a new way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
fighting. The Spaniards were perplexed and horrified.
Their only thought was to escape anywhere,
no matter where, if only they could get
free from these terrors. In their haste anchor
chains fouled, some ships collided, others burned
or ran aground.</p>

<p>The land forces were encamped at Tilbury. “I
am commander in chief of my troops,” declared
Elizabeth, “and I shall go to pay them a visit.”</p>

<p>“Is it safe to commit yourself to armed multitudes?
Among so many there may well be
treachery,” suggested her councilors.</p>

<p>“Let tyrants fear,” returned Elizabeth. “I
am true to my people, and they are my faithful
and loving subjects. I should rather die than
live in fear and distrust of them. I shall go to
visit my loyal soldiers.”</p>

<p>It must have been a brilliant sight, the long
lines of soldiers in battle array, and the queen
riding in front of the lines on her great charger.
Before her went Leicester and another noble
bearing the sword of state. Behind her followed
a page carrying her helmet with its white plumes.
She was magnificently dressed, but over her dress
was a corslet of polished steel. Back and forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
before the lines she rode, while the soldiers
shouted, “Queen Elizabeth! Queen Elizabeth!
God save the queen! The Lord keep her!” She
raised her hand, and there was silence to hear
her words.</p>

<p>“I have the body of a weak, feeble woman,”
she said, “but I have the heart of a king, of a
king of England, and I think it foul scorn that
any prince of Europe should dare to invade the
borders of my realm. Rather than that any dishonor
should come by me, I will take up arms,
I will be your general myself, and the rewarder
of every deed of bravery. You deserve already
rewards and crowns, and they shall be paid. It
will not be long before we have a famous victory
over these enemies of my God, of my kingdom,
and of my people.”</p>

<p>While Elizabeth was still at Tilbury, two messengers
came with a thrilling report.</p>

<p>“A fierce battle has been fought off Gravelines.
Drake was in command.”</p>

<p>“My noble sailor laddie,” said the queen
proudly. “Tell me of it. I would know the
deeds of every one of my brave captains.”</p>

<p>“It is your Majesty who struck the fatal blow,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
said the messenger, “for the fire-ships were your
own thought, and it was they that thrust the
Spaniards from our coast and drove them out to
sea. Sir Francis and his fleet led the attack.
Six hours it lasted, till every shot, large and
small, had been fired. Then came the Admiral,
and he, too, fired every shot. There was no more
powder, but he put on a bold front and gave
them chase. They could not go south, and they
went north.”</p>

<p>“There’s no fear in Howard,” said Elizabeth.
“I know my man. Where are the Spaniards
now?”</p>

<p>“Many of them have gone to whatever place
the mercy of the Lord may consign them,” was
the reply.</p>

<p>“And where are those that still depend upon
the mercies of wind and wave?” asked the queen.</p>

<p>“Only wind and wave can tell?” answered
the messenger. “The ships sailed far to the
northward. The Admiral pursued until his provisions
failed, but there was small need of searching
for the enemy. The boisterous northern seas
will do the work of many a cannon.”</p>

<p>The words of the messenger proved to be true.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
The Spanish ships ran aground on the unknown
coasts, they were shattered by storms, the sailors
were stricken by pestilence, they were driven
ashore only to be thrust back into the waves, for
King James had no idea of doing aught against
the sovereign whose crown he hoped would before
many years rest upon his own head, and the
lord lieutenant of Ireland was little inclined to
show mercy to the enemies of his country. Of
the great fleet that left Spain, so strong that it
ventured to call itself invincible, more than half
the ships were left on the rocks or at the bottom
of the sea.</p>

<span class="subhead">CLOSING YEARS</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">After</span> the defeat of the Armada not only
was there a general rejoicing, but the
whole land felt a new sense of freedom.
Until 1588 Elizabeth had been obliged to steer
the ship of state with the utmost wariness. She
must keep on good terms with Scotland, lest that
country should turn to France for friendship.
She must make sure that France would not
oppose her, lest Philip should join the ruler of
the land across the Channel. She must help the
Low Countries sufficiently to strengthen their opposition
to the Spanish king and so keep him
from England, but she must not give them so
much aid that they would become a burden upon
her in their dependence, and she must not accept
the Protectorate, that would perhaps involve her
realm in a long and bloody war with Spain. For
thirty years this keen, shrewd scheming went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
on. England was gaining every day in power
and wealth, and when at last “Old Leadenfoot”
began to bestir himself, the country was ready
to meet him.</p>

<p>The Armada had come and gone, and England
was free. Philip might talk as boastfully as he
would about sending another fleet to make another
attack, but no one forgot that he had sent
a fleet and it had failed. England was “mistress
of the seas” in the sense that she was no longer
in fear of any other nation. If a Spanish vessel
encountered an English vessel, they would be
likely to fight, but the Englishmen expected to
win, and that expectation of victory was in itself
a mark of greatness. If England chose to plant
colonies in the New World, there was little fear
that Spain would trouble them to any great extent.</p>

<p>This new sense of freedom showed itself not
only in what was done but in what was written,
and often the same man that had written an undying
poem could fight a battle or lead a voyage of
discovery or plan what was best for the nation
when there were difficult questions of state to decide.
Shakespeare himself, the greatest writer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
all, was not only a poet but a keen, thrifty man
of business.</p>

<p>The people of England had become accustomed
to seeing great deeds done before their eyes, and
that is one reason why few stories were written
but many plays, for it seemed much more “real”
to see a tale acted on the stage than to hear an
account of it.</p>

<p>It was a great pity that this freedom could
not have extended to religious matters, but it was
some years after Queen Elizabeth’s death before
many people realized that it was possible for
two persons to have entirely different ideas of
religion and yet be honest and sincere and live
peacefully together. Toward the close of Elizabeth’s
reign there were persecutions of those refusing
to attend the Church of England that were
far more severe than the mild system of fines
with which she began her rule. The fines were
increased, and Puritans as well as Catholics were
sometimes ruined by the large sums of money
that they were obliged to pay if they persisted
in refusing to attend the services of the Church
of England. They were often imprisoned, and
in the Elizabethan days imprisonment was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
light penalty. Not only were the jails damp,
unhealthy, filthy places, but prisoners were obliged
to pay many exorbitant charges, so that if a man
escaped with his life and health, he had to leave
large sums of money behind him. One jail bill
of that day has a weekly item of five dollars and
a half for food, and as money would purchase
about five times as much then as now, this charge
was equivalent to more than twenty-seven dollars
to-day. This was not all by any means, for a
prisoner had to pay the rent of his wretched
dungeon. If he was doomed to wear fetters, he
must pay extra for them, and, most absurd charge
of all, he was forced to pay an entrance fee on
being sent to the horrible place. Besides being
imprisoned, dissenters, as those were called who
would not attend the Church of England, were
sometimes whipped or tortured or even hanged.
The only excuse for such treatment is that neither
the queen nor her council was in fault for not
being a century in advance of their times. Indeed,
it was more than two centuries after the
death of the queen before England would allow
a Catholic to become a member of Parliament.</p>

<p>As Elizabeth drew older, she dressed with increasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
magnificence. Her hands were loaded
with rings, and her robes were made of the richest
material that could be obtained. A German
traveler who saw her on her way to her private
chapel describes her as wearing a dress of heavy
white silk, made with a very long train and
bordered with pearls as large as beans. She
wore a deep collar made of gold and jewels. This
same traveler says that every corner of her palace
shone with gold and silver and crystal and
precious stones, and yet her floors were strewn
with rushes that were probably as dirty as those
in the homes of her subjects.</p>

<p>The end of the century drew near, and it
brought sorrow to the queen in the death of her
old adviser, Lord Burleigh. Leicester had died
soon after the defeat of the Armada, and Elizabeth
never parted with a paper upon which she
had written sadly, “His last letter.” In Burleigh’s
old age he became quite infirm, and while
Elizabeth’s other ministers addressed her kneeling,
Burleigh was always made to seat himself
comfortably before she would discuss any question
with him. “I am too old and too feeble to
serve you well,” he would say, but she refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
to let him resign his office. In the days of his
strength, she would storm at him in a tornado of
rage when his judgment differed from hers, but
as he became weak and ill, she was the tenderest
of friends. “The door is low, your Majesty,”
said the servant as she entered the sickroom of
the councilor. “Then I will stoop,” said she,
“for your master’s sake, though never for the
king of Spain.” She often went to sit by his bedside,
and the haughty sovereign whose wrath
burst forth so furiously at a word of opposition
became the most gentle of nurses. As she sat
beside him, she would allow no hand but her own
to give him nourishment. “She never speaks of
him without tears,” said one who was with her
after his death.</p>

<p>The loss of another of her friends brought her
even greater grief than that of Burleigh, for this
time the life of her favorite lay in her own power,
but as the faithful sovereign she felt herself
obliged to sacrifice it. From the time that Leicester
had presented to her his brilliant, fascinating
stepson, the Earl of Essex, the young man
had been a prime favorite with the queen. At
their first meeting he was seventeen and the queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
fifty-six, and she treated him like a petted child
who can do no wrong. She forbade him to take
any part in the fighting in Portugal, but he
slipped away from court without her knowledge,
and was the first to leave the boats on the Portuguese
coast. He returned with some fear of
being punished for his disobedience, but the queen
forgot the wrongdoing, and was only anxious to
make up for his disappointment because a position
that he had wished for had been given to
some one else.</p>

<p>When Essex married, Elizabeth was as indignant
as usual at each new proof that with all the
adoration that her courtiers continually declared
of herself, she was not the whole world to them.
When Essex was fighting in Holland, a request
was sent to the queen for more troops. The ambassador
<span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Your Majesty, my master has consulted the
Earl of Essex, and he favors the request.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth had not yet granted Essex her forgiveness,
and she blazed <span class="locked">forth:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The Earl of Essex, indeed! He would have
it thought that he rules my realm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
In spite of her anger with him, she was so
anxious when she knew how carelessly he risked
his life that she wrote ordering him to return
to England at once, and when, much against
his will, he obeyed her command, she spent a
week in feasting and merriment. Over and over
they quarreled. Essex would perhaps favor one
candidate for a position, and the queen another.
There would be hot words between them, and
they would part, both in a fury. Then Essex
would pretend to be ill, and the repentant queen
would go to see the spoiled child, and pardon his
petulance unasked. “He is not to blame, he
takes it from his mother,” she would say, and
as she especially disliked his mother, she admitted
this as sufficient excuse for overlooking
his impertinence. The great storm came when
the queen named a lord lieutenant for Ireland,
and Essex opposed. Elizabeth made one of her
severe speeches, and the young man retorted by
shrugging his shoulders and turning his back
on her. The queen replied by soundly boxing
his ears. Essex grasped his sword. “I wouldn’t
have pardoned that blow even from King Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
himself. What else could one expect from an
old king in petticoats!” he cried and dashed
away from court.</p>

<p>His friends urged him to return and try to
regain the affection of the queen by a humble
apology, but for many weeks he refused. “I
am the queen’s servant,” said he, “but I am not
her slave.” However, he finally sued for pardon
and was again forgiven.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Last moments of Elizabeth.&mdash;<i>From painting by Delaroche.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>So long as the offences of Essex were against
Elizabeth as a woman, she was ready to forgive,
but at last he committed a crime against her government,
and the woman was forgotten in the
sovereign. All through the reign there was
trouble with Ireland. The Irish hated the English
and would follow anyone who would lead
them against English rule. There were continual
rebellions. Essex’s enemies brought it about that
the favorite should be sent to command what he
called “the cursedest of all islands.” Before
long, rumors of his mismanagement began to
reach the ears of the queen. “He is ever forcing
his soldiers to make wearisome and useless
marches and countermarches,” said the reports.
“He wastes money and supplies, and he exhausts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
his troops by irregular skirmishes that
amount to nothing. He has made a foolish peace
with the leader of the Irish rebels instead of suppressing
them by force of arms. He is trying
to make himself king of the Irish, and he will
then raise an Irish army to come over and dethrone
the queen.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth sent letters full of reproof to Essex,
but the young fellow only said to himself, “They
are not her letters. She has written the words,
but it is Burleigh who has guided her pen.” He
abandoned his command and went straight to
England, sure that the queen would pardon any
misdeed on the part of her favorite.</p>

<p>Early one morning the young man arrived in
London. He must see the queen before his enemies
could have word of her and induce her to forbid
him to appear at court, and he galloped wildly
on to the palace. He looked into the audience
chamber, she was not there; into the privy chamber,
she was not there. Then he burst into her
dressing room where the queen sat with her
women brushing her hair. He was muddy with
his mad gallop to the palace, his clothes were
disordered and travelstained, but when he threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
himself at her feet and pleaded, “Don’t judge
me by the tales of my enemies,” the queen was so
kind to him that he thought himself forgiven.
Later, however, she saw that he had committed
many acts of disobedience which in a military
commander were unpardonable. He was tried by
the privy council, and for a few weeks was confined
to his own house. Elizabeth deprived him
of several valuable monopolies and even after
his release forbade him to appear at court. In any
other commander the penalty of such crimes would
have been far more severe, but instead of thinking
upon the mercy that had been shown him,
Essex meditated upon what he thought his
wrongs. He became more and more embittered,
and at last he tried to arouse a rebellion against
the queen. There was a fierce struggle in Elizabeth’s
mind between her love for the young man
and her duty to punish the treason. At last she
signed the death warrant, recalled it, then signed
another, and Essex was executed in the Tower
of London.</p>

<p>The seventeenth century began, and the health
of the queen was clearly failing. A woman of
less strength of character would have posed as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
an invalid, but Elizabeth seemed to feel that sickness
was unworthy of a queen, and she concealed
her increasing weakness as far as possible. She
often had to be lifted upon her horse, but she
would not give up riding. She even went to visit
one of her councilors. Cornets saluted her,
drums and trumpets sounded as she entered the
courtyard. She watched the dancing of the
ladies of the house and the feats of horsemanship
and swordplay of the young men, but she was exhausted,
and in spite of her good courage, she
could not go up the stairs without a staff. Yet in
the early part of 1602 she went a-Maying in the
old fashion of celebrating the coming of spring.</p>

<p>With all her glory and her greatness, the last
days of this woman on a throne were more lonely
than those of a woman in a cottage. Essex had
been a great favorite among the people, and they
had never forgiven his death. When the queen
showed herself among them, she was no longer
received with all the old tokens of loyalty and affection,
and no one could have been more keen
than she to note the least change in the manner
of her subjects.</p>

<p>She knew that James would be her heir, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
she had not forgotten the long lines of greedy
courtiers who had sought her when her sister
Mary was near her end, and she refused to name
him definitely as the one whom she wished to succeed
her. This refusal made little difference, however,
in the increasing devotion of those around
her to the Scotch king, who would so soon be the
ruler of England. One after another wearied of
attendance; some made excuses to leave her,
others left without excuse. The son of Burleigh,
who had taken his father’s place, sent almost
daily epistles to Scotland. Harington, who used
to write her merry, jesting letters, signed “Your
Majesty’s saucy godson,” had sent valuable gifts
to the King of Scots, and a petition that he might
not be forgotten when James should come into his
kingdom. Her own councilors were sending
messengers to James hoping to win his favor.
Two of her relatives stood by her bedside, but
their watchfulness arose not from affection but
that they might be the first to tell James that
the crown was his at last.</p>

<p>The queen became more and more feeble. She
was sad and melancholy. Often she sat for hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
alone in the dark weeping. She felt her loneliness
most keenly. “Whom can I trust? Whom can
I trust?” her attendants heard her murmur. A
kinsman who went to see her said that she drew
heavy sighs continually, “And I never knew her
to sigh” he declared, “save at the death of the
Queen of Scots.” She lay on cushions piled up
on the floor.</p>

<p>“Madam,” urged the son of Burleigh, “will
you not be moved to your bed?”</p>

<p>“If I go to my bed, I shall never leave it,” she
answered.</p>

<p>“But you must in order to content your loving
subjects,” he urged.</p>

<p>Then the queen showed once more her proud
Tudor blood. “‘Must’ is no word to use to
princes,” said she, “and, little man, if your father
had lived, even he would not have dared to say so
much.”</p>

<p>She passed away quietly in a gentle sleep. According
to a strange custom of the times an image
of her was made in wax, decked in the royal robes,
and laid upon her coffin. She was buried in Westminster
Abbey, and as the sad procession went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
through the streets, the early love of her subjects
returned in full measure. An old chronicler
<span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“And when they beheld her statue, or effigy,
lying on the coffin, set forth in royal robes, having
a crown upon the head thereof, and a ball and
sceptre in either hand, there was such a general
sighing, groaning, and weeping, as the like hath
not been seen or known in the memory of man;
neither doth any history mention any people, time,
or state, to make like lamentation for the death
of their sovereign.”</p>
